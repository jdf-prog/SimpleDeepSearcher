Assuming this really is an XML document, what you're doing might work, but you should know that using an XML parser will be more reliable. To parse this document as XML, make sure you have the Python package 'lxml' installed, and pass the keyword argument `features="xml"` into the BeautifulSoup constructor.

If you want or need to use an HTML parser on this document, you can make this warning go away by filtering it. To do that, run this code before calling the BeautifulSoup constructor:

    from bs4 import XMLParsedAsHTMLWarning
    import warnings

    warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=XMLParsedAsHTMLWarning)

  soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

The regal blue tang can be found throughout the Indo-Pacific. It is seen in the reefs of the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan, the Great Barrier ...",\n  "context": "acific surgeonfish . A popular fish in marine aquaria , it is the only member of the genus Paracanthurus . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] A number of common names are attributed to the species, including regal tang , palette surgeonfish , blue tang (leading to confusion with the Atlantic species Acanthurus coeruleus ), royal blue tang , hippo tang , blue hippo tang , flagtail surgeonfish , Pacific regal blue tang , and blue surgeonfish , hepatus tang , Indo-Pacific blue tang , regal blue surgeonfish , wedge-tailed tang , wedgetail blue tang . [ 4 ] It is most closely related to genus Zebrasoma , with which it forms a sister group. [ 5 ] Description [ edit ] Young juvenile, in Indonesia Paracanthurus hepatus has a royal blue body, yellow tail, and black \\"palette\\" design. Its length at first sexual maturity is 149.2\xa0mm. [ 6 ] Adults typically weigh around 600\xa0g (21\xa0oz) and males are generally larger than females. [ 7 ] The back has a broad black area that encloses at the tip of the pectoral , creating a blue oval on each side of the fish that extends in the direction of the eye. [ 8 ] The tail has a bright yellow triangle with its apex anterior to the caudal spine and its base at the posterior end of the caudal fin . Black surrounds the triangle on the upper and lower lobes of the caudal fin, in the same hue as the back area. [ 8 ] Paracanthurus has small small scales , each with short ctenii on the upper surface. [ 8 ] Scales on the caudal spine possess ctenii approximately three times as long as scales on the rest of the body. Scales anteriorly placed on the head between the eye and the upper jaw are larger with tuberculated, bony plates. [ 9 ] [ 8 ] With fins fully extended This fish has a compressed, elliptical body shape, and a terminal snout. [ 8 ] It has nine dorsal spines, 26–28 dorsal soft rays, three anal spines, and 24–26 anal soft yellow rays, and 16 principal caudal rays with slightly projecting upper and lower lobes. [ 8 ] Its pelvic fin is made up of one spine and three rays; this characteristic is considered a synapomorphy of the Naso and Paracanthurus genus. [ 9 ] The caudal peduncle has a spine located in a shallow groove, which is also a characteristic of its sister taxa Zebrasoma . [ 9 ] It has 22 vertebrae. [ 8 ] Paracanthurus has teeth that are small, close-set, denticulated, [ 8 ] and described as incisor-like. [ 9 ] Jaw morphology includes an ectopterygoid that links the palatine to the quadrate near the articular condyle. [ 9 ] A crest is present on the anterodorsal surface of the hyomandibular . The opercle is less developed, with a distinctly convex profile. [ 9 ] Some slight variation in appearance is present within Paracanthurus . [ 10 ] The lower body is yellow in west-central Indian Ocean [ 11 ] individuals, and bluish in Pacific individuals (4). Additionally, the blue color on the trunk of Paracanthurus loses pigmentation in response to changes in light and/or melatonin levels, making its appearance slightly lighter in color at night. [ 10 ] Distribution [ edit ] The regal blue tang can be found throughout the Indo-Pacific . It is seen in the reefs of the Philippines , Indonesia , Japan , the Great Barrier Reef of Australia, New Caledonia , Samoa , East Africa , and Sri Lanka . [ 12 ] [ 2 ] A single specimen was photographed in 2015 in the Mediterranean Sea off Israel. [ 13 ] Vagrants were found two separate occasions in Hawaii, and are assumed to be aquarium releases. [ 4 ] Paracanthurus is an extant resident in the following territories: American Samoa; Australia; British Indian Ocean Territory; Brunei Darussalam; Christmas Island; Cocos (Keeling) Islands; Comoros; Cook Islands; Disputed Territory (Paracel Is., Spratly Is.); Fiji; French Southern Territories (Mozambique Channel Is.); Guam; India (Nicobar Is., Andaman Is.); Indonesia; Japan; Kenya; Kiribati (Kiribati Line Is., Phoenix Is., Gilbert Is.); Madagascar; Malaysia; Maldives; Marshall Islands; Mauritius; Mayotte; Micronesia, Federated States of\xa0; Myanmar; Nauru; New Caledonia; Niue; Northern Mariana Islands; Palau; Papua New Guinea; Philippines; Réunion; Samoa; Seychelles; Singapore; Solomon Islands; Somalia; South Africa; Sri Lanka; Taiwan, Province of China; Tanzania, United Republic of; Thailand; Timor-Leste; Tokelau; Tonga; Tuvalu; United States (Hawaiian Is.); United States Minor Outlying Islands (US Line Is., Howland-Baker Is.); Vanuatu; Viet Nam; Wallis and Futuna. [ 4 ] Ecology [ edit ] Paracanthurus is a diurnal [ 10 ] marine species that occupies marine neritic habitats along coastlines. [ 14 ] It is found in clear water on exposed outer reef areas or in channels with a moderate or strong current. [ 4 ] It primarily utilizes coral reef habitats, but is also known to utilize seagrass beds, mangroves, algal beds, and rocky reefs [1]. It has an upper and lower depth limit of 2 meters and 40 meters, respectively . [ 4 ] They live in pairs or small groups of 8 to 14 individuals. They can also be found near cauliflower corals on the seaweed side of coral reefs. Juveniles can be found in schools using Acropora for shelter. Numbers of males and females tend to maintain a 1:1 ratio. [ 6 ] The fish is important for coral health as it eats algae that may otherwise choke it by overgrowth. [ 15 ] Diet [ edit ] As a juvenile, its diet consists primarily of plankton . Adults are omnivorous and feed on zooplankton , but will also graze on filamentous algae . [ 16 ] Life cycle [ edit ] Juveniles Spawning takes place year round, with a peak between April and September. [ 6 ] Spawning occurs during late afternoon and evening hours around outer reef slopes. [ 4 ] This event is indicated by a change in color from a uniform dark blue to a pale blue. Males aggressively court female members of the school, leading to a quick upward spawning rush toward the surface of the water during which eggs and sperm are released. The eggs are small, approximately 0.8 millimetres ( 1 ⁄ 32 in) in diameter. The eggs are pelagic , each containing a single droplet of oil for flotation. The fertilized eggs hatch in twenty-four hours, reve"\n}\n**Web Page 2:**\n{\n  "id": 2,\n  "title": "Blue Tang – Discover Fishes - Florida Museum of Natural History",\n  "url": "https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/discover-fish/species-profiles/blue-tang/",\n  "site_name": "",\n  "date": "",\n  "snippet": "The blue tang is found in the western Atlantic Ocean from New York and Bermuda to the Gulf of Mexico, south to Brazil.

Photo © John Soward Acanthurus coeruleus This oval-shaped tropical reef fish is a popular aquarium and bait fish that has three color phases of its life. It isn’t often consumed because of the strong odor and chance of ciguaterra poisoning. Handle with care if catching because of the sharp spine hidden in the caudal peduncle (narrow area just before the tail). These vegetarians play an important role on the reefs by eating the algae that can grow over the coral and kill it. Order – Perciformes Family – Acanthuridae Genus – Acanthurus Species – coeruleus Common Names English common names include blue tang , blue barber, blue doctor, blue doctorfish, blue tang surgeonfish, blur tang, yellow barber, and yellow doctorfish. Other names are barbeiro (Portuguese), barbero (Spanish), barbero azul (Spanish), chirurgien bayolle (French), chirurgien bleu (French), cirujano (Spanish), doctor (Spanish), medico (Spanish), navajon azul (Spanish), pokolec turkusowy (Polish), sangrador azul (Spanish), and siwizye (Creole). Importance to Humans Blue tangs and sea fan. Photo courtesy NOAA The blue tang is of minor commercial fisheries importance, however it is occasionally utilized as a bait fish. The flesh has a strong odor and is not highly prized. This fish may cause ciguaterra poisoning if consumed by humans. However, blue tangs are collected commercially for the aquarium trade. An unwary human who tries to handle the blue tang risks the chances of being badly cut by the caudal spine. These spines, on both sides of the caudal peduncle, are extended from the body when the fish becomes excited. The quick, thrashing sideways motion of the tail can produce deep wounds that result in swelling and discoloration, posing a high risk of infection. The pain can last for hours, until eventually subsiding into a dull ache. It is believed that some species of Acathurus have venom glands while others do not. The spines are used only as a method of protection against aggressors. Conservation > Check the status of the blue tang at the IUCN website . The IUCN is a global union of states, governmental agencies, and non-governmental organizations in a partnership that assesses the conservation status of species. World distribution map for the blue tang Geographical Distribution The blue tang is found in the western Atlantic Ocean from New York and Bermuda to the Gulf of Mexico, south to Brazil. It is abundant in Florida, Bahamas, and the Caribbean Sea. In the eastern Atlantic Ocean it occurs near Ascension Island. Habitat Blue tangs schooling over rocky coral reef. Photo courtesy NOAA Tangs are found in coral reefs and inshore grassy or rocky areas at depths of 6-131 feet (2-40 m). In coral reefs, blue tangs live in holes and crevices where they are sheltered from predators while they sleep at night. The blue tang lives singly, in pairs, or in small groups of up to 10 or 12 individuals, although occasionally it forms large aggregations that forage about the shallow reefs, grazing on algae. These aggregations sometimes include doctorfish ( Acanthurus chirurgus ) and other surgeonfish. The juvenile blue tang is rarely seen on the reef due to its small size and need for constant cover from predators. The intermediate phase with the blue body and yellow tail is often observed on reefs while young adults are abundant everywhere on the reef. Biology Juvenile blue tang with yellow coloration. Photo © Doug Perrine Distinctive Features The blue tang is a high-bodied, compressed, pancake-shaped fish with a pointed snout and small scales. The eye is located high on the head and the mouth is small and low on the head. The dorsal fin is continuous. Of particular interest is the distinct yellow caudal spine located at the base of the tail on either side of the body, a characteristic shared with other surgeonfish. This spine fits into a horizontal groove and can be extended and used to fend off aggressive encounters. Coloration This fish has three color phases. In its juvenile phase, it is bright yellow, changing to a mixture of yellow and blue during adolescence. There may be blue crescents above and below the pupils of the eyes. It may be spotted with blue or have a yellow body and blue fins. Juvenile blue tang. Photo © Keri Wilk As the fish matures into the intermediate phase, the color darkens to a bright blue or purplish-gray with a yellow caudal fin. Gray longitudinal lines are located in the flank region with blue dorsal and anal fins banded with orange-brown diagonal lines. The caudal spine is yellow to pale yellow or white. At night, blue tangs display white vertical stripes. Adult blue tangs are deep blue to purplish-blue with a yellow caudal spine. The change from juvenile to intermediate to adult coloration is not size-dependent as some fish in the juvenile yellow phase may be larger than the adult blue phase. Blue tang. Photo © David Snyder Dentition The close-set, spatulate teeth of the blue tang are well adapted for nipping, grazing, and browsing algae from the reef. There are 14 teeth on the upper jaw and 16 teeth on the lower jaw. Size, Age, and Growth The blue tang reaches approximately 12 inches (30.5 cm) in length. The largest specimen, caught off the coast of South America, measured 14.4 inches (37 cm). It reaches sexual maturity at 9-12 months of age and lengths of 4-5 inches (11-13 cm).

Paracanthurus hepatus (palette surgeonfish) Marine Fishes Exotic Collection Info Point Map Species Profile Animated Map Paracanthurus hepatus Linnaeus, 1766 Common name: palette surgeonfish Synonyms and Other Names: hippo tang, Pacific blue tang, regal tang Taxonomy: available through www.itis.gov Identification: Randall (2002) describes the palette surgeonfish as having an elongate body with a truncate caudal fin. It is a striking blue color with a black band curving upward from the eye, broadening on the body, continuing to the full width of the caudal peduncle. The body contains a large elliptical blue area centered above the tip of the pectoral fin. The caudal fin is yellow with broad black upper and lower margins. The yellow extends forward to enclose the single folding spine on the caudal peduncle. Size: This species can reach a total length of 31 cm (Myers 1999). Native Range: Palette surgeon fish are native to the Pacific and Indian oceans from East Africa to Indonesia, Micronesia, Samoa, New Caledonia and Line Islands and from southwest Japan to the Great Barrier Reef (Allen et al 2003).

State First Observed Last Observed Total HUCs with observations† HUCs with observations† FL 2020 2020 1 Florida Southeast Coast Table last updated 8/12/2025 † Populations may not be currently present. Ecology: The palette surgeonfish is found in loose aggregations on the exposed edges of outer reefs in flowing current 2 to 40 m deep (Myer 1999, Randall 2002). When frightened individuals may wedge themselves among coral branches for shelter (Myers 1999). The species feeds on zooplankton and benthic algae (Randall 2002). Surgeonfishes get their common name from their ability to slash other fishes with their sharp caudal spine. In addition to the sharp caudal spine, the palette surgeon fish has venomous dorsal, anal, and pelvic spines (Randall et al. 1990). Means of Introduction: Probable aquarium release. Status: Unknown Impact of Introduction: The impacts of this species are currently unknown, as no studies have been done to determine how it has affected ecosystems in the invaded range. The absence of data does not equate to lack of effects. It does, however, mean that research is required to evaluate effects before conclusions can be made.

(Mental Floss) How do scientists study blue tangs? With coral reef surveys like this one. Educators, scroll down for a quick list of key resources in our Teachers’ Toolkit. This photo of a blue tang clearly shows the caudal spine, yellow, slightly extended near the fish’s tail. Photograph by DerHans04, courtesy Wikimedia. CC-BY-SA-3.0,2.5,2.0,1.0 Discussion Ideas 1. Blue tangs aren’t always blue, and they’re not always tangs. Juvenile blue tangs are bright yellow. And adult blue tangs can actually modulate their color based on environmental conditions. Under stress, for example, their blue coloration deepens to violet and the black marks may become slightly bleached. Blue tangs get their color from cells called iridiphores, a type of chromatophore . Iridiphores are crystal structures of guanine (the famous G in our DNA tetrarchy of guanine, cytosine, adenine, and thymine). The crystalline arrangement reflects light at a specific spectrum and determines the animal’s color. Dory’s species of blue tang, Paracanthurus hepatus , has many different names: blue tang, doctorfish, common surgeon, regal tang, palette surgeonfish, royal blue tang, hippo tang, flagtail surgeonfish, Pacific regal blue tang, and blue surgeonfish. Paracanthurus hepatus is often confused with Acanthurus leucosternon and Acanthurus coeruleus . The three fish look very different, but are all known as blue tang—be careful when you’re researching! 2. Blue tang are everywhere and nowhere. Blue tang are not listed on the IUCN list of endangered species; their populations are pretty healthy and they’re of “least concern.” However, as a nice sentence on Wikipedia notes, “the species’ range is broad, but it is common nowhere.” Blue tang are indigenous to warm, shallow tropical reefs of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Blue tang are entirely helpless when they hatch, lacking a pigments, eyes, a mouth or even a heartbeat. They drift with the currents for about five hours after hatching. 3. Blue tang are important parts of the coral reef food web . Adult blue tangs are omnivores that feed primarily on algae , but can also consume plankton . These first-order consumers keep “ algae levels on coral down to a manageable level . Without the blue tang there to eat their fill, algae could overgrow and suffocate the reefs.” Blue tangs themselves are prey for important secondary consumers such as tuna, grouper, and barracuda. 4. Blue tangs are poison. Blue tangs often carry a toxin called ciguatera . Symptoms of ciguatera poisoning are usually limited to vomiting and diarrhea, but may also include more serious symptoms such as headaches, muscle aches, and even hallucinations and heart and breathing problems. FYI: Some scientists think an outbreak of ciguatera poisoning in islands of the Malay Archipelago may have prompted the great Polynesian ocean migrations of the early 1000s. (!!!) 5. Blue tangs will cut you. As its “surgeonfish” name indicates, blue tangs are handy with scalpels . The fish have caudal spines—very sharp spines that can be extended from either side of their caudal peduncle (the area where the tail joins the body). The caudal spine contains toxins that can cause a debilitating pain to small predators and uncomfortable irritation and pain in humans. Blue tangs extend their caudal spine and thrash around when threatened. The defense mechanism is useful. Some parrotfish , which are similarly colored but lack caudal spines or toxins, often join groups of blue tang for protection. 5½. Think twice before adding a blue tang to your aquarium. Blue tangs are already some of the most popular fish in saltwater aquariums, and many scientists and businesses think Finding Dory will only increase demand . However, while the aquarium trade may help save many species of reef fish (including clownfish—Nemo!), it doesn’t bode as well for the blue tang. The reason: Blue tangs are not bred in captivity. That means they’re all caught in the wild, putting a stress on natural populations. Blue tangs can live more than 30 years in the wild. In aquariums, where they more readily acquire diseases, they generally survive about 8 to 12 years. The beautiful blue tang lives in the Ulm Zoo in Germany. Photograph by H.

They are known as surgeonfish because they can slice you with their sharp, spiny caudal fins. Adults are blue, ranging from a deep blue or even purplish to much paler blue. Surprisingly, as juveniles, Blue Tang are bright yellow. As they grow, they become blue, with the tail being the last part to lose the yellow. Blue Tang are herbivores, cruising constantly round reefs feeding on algae. They also act as cleaners of other fish species, removing parasites. They themselves may be cleaned by gobies by visiting so-called ‘cleaning stations’. These piscine beauty parlours have a medicinal purpose as well, since cleaning helps to cure minor wounds. These fish often move around reefs in large schools, as shown in the header image. Apart from having some value as an aquarium fish, they are not generally of use to humans. Their spiny caudal fins can cause a nasty wound. They have an unpleasant smell. Their flesh supposedly contains toxins, and they\xa0carrying a risk of the disease CIGUATERA . I can’t even find a recipe for them online – now, that is a bad sign, there are some people who will try anything. I guess best to boil them for an hour or two, drain the water, allow to cool, and throw away the fish. FUN FACT In the Disney/Pixar\xa0film Finding Nemo , the character Dory (voiced by\xa0Ellen DeGeneres) is a blue tang. BLUE TANG: THE MOVIE [RE-RELEASE] “RECIPE Take one incompetent swimmer who hasn’t snorkelled in, oh, nearly 40 years. Place him over a coral reef for his first time ever. Add a small underwater camera totally alien to him. Immerse for 30 minutes in warm briny water. Lessons have been learnt for next time. Mainly, don’t keep waving the camera about; let the fish move round you rather than vice versa; and most important of all, remember to keep breathing or else… Here is BLUE TANG: THE MOVIE\xa0(music by Adrian Legg), 45 secs of advanced camera-shake with some beautiful fish more or less in shot for most of the time. If you are prone to sea-sickness, do not enlarge the video. If you are allergic to poor photography… well, thanks for visiting.” [vimeo\xa0https://vimeo.com/44794952] Credits: Good pictures, Melinda; bad pictures and execrable movie, not Melinda Share this: Click to print (Opens in new window) Print Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Reddit Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Tumblr Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Pinterest Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Pocket Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp More Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) Email Click to share on Bluesky (Opens in new window) Bluesky Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X Like Loading...

It is typically a solitary and territorial fish and is an herbivore feeding mainly on algae. Originally published: March 30, 2020 Last updated: October 29, 2024 Credit: Ken Kurtis/Aquarium of the Pacific Credit: Robin Riggs/Aquarium of the Pacific SPECIES IN DETAIL Powder Blue Tang Acanthurus leucosternon CONSERVATION STATUS: Least concern CLIMATE CHANGE: At the Aquarium The Aquarium has powder blue tangs in the Tropical Reef Habitat, Soft Coral Garden, Live Coral, and Tropical Pacific Preview exhibits in the Tropical Pacific Gallery and in Shark Lagoon’s large touch pool. Geographic Distribution Powder blue tangs are found throughout the Indian Ocean, from eastern Africa to the Andaman Sea, southwest Indonesia, and Christmas Island, into the western Pacific Ocean to Bali, Indonesia. Habitat Powder blue tangs live in clear shallow waters surrounding inshore coral reefs, specifically preferring reef flats and upper seaward slopes. Physical Characteristics The powder blue tang has an oval-shaped laterally compressed body. Its body color is vivid blue with a black head and a broad white band from pectoral fin to throat. It has a vivid yellow coloration on its dorsal fin and at the base of the caudal fin. It has white pelvic and anal fins and a crescent-shaped caudal fin. It has a small, pointed, beak-like mouth with tiny sharp teeth. It has an erected spine on each side of the caudal peduncle base. Size These fish have an average length of 7.5 to 9 inches (19 to 23 centimeters) and a maximum length of 21 inches (54 centimeters). Diet This species grazes on benthic algae, either singly or in large feeding groups. Reproduction Powder blue tangs practice monogamous (pair) spawning. Behavior This fish grazes singly or in large feeding groups. When food isn’t plentiful, it may become aggressive to other fish invading its territory. It will feed in groups if food is plentiful. Adaptation The shape of its beak-like mouth is useful for accessing algae in small crevices. Longevity In the wild powder blue tangs typically live for about five years. They can live up to ten years in an aquarium setting. Conservation The powder blue tang is listed as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Despite their name, they are not always blue; juveniles are born bright yellow and turn blue as they age. Adults have a flat blue body with a yellow tail and black palette design. The spines along the top and bottom of its body give it the name “surgeonfish.” The regal blue tang is a type of surgeon fish found throughout the Indo-Pacific waters. They inhabit clear waters in various coral reefs with lots of seaweed in pairs or small groups of up to 14 fish. The regal blue tang goes by many names such as the hippo tang, the Pacific blue tang, palette surgeonfish, blue surgeonfish, flagtail surgeonfish, and more. Regal blue tangs are important to the health of a coral reef as they eat algae that may have killed the coral. Besides eating algae, the tang’s omnivorous diet also has them eating plankton like their juvenile selves. During the breeding season, many male and female regal blue tangs will congregate. In the average spawning season, females will release 40,000 eggs in total while the males will release their sperm into the water. This increases the likelihood of fertilization and decreases the chances of the eggs being eaten by predators. The eggs will hatch in about a day and stay in plankton until they become juveniles and then develop in the coral. Regal blue tangs can be both venomous and poisonous. If they feel threatened, they can raise two sharp spines by their tail and shake their body from side to side to try to sting their attacker. The spines are tipped with a toxin that can debilitate prey and hurt humans. If eaten, regal blue tangs can cause severe stomach problems from the dinoflagellates the regal blue tangs eat.

{'role': 'user', 'content': '**Task Instruction:**\n\nYou are tasked with reading and analyzing web pages based on the following inputs: **Previous Reasoning Steps**, **Current Search Query**, and **Searched Web Pages**. Your objective is to extract relevant and helpful information for **Current Search Query** from the **Searched Web Pages** and seamlessly integrate this information into the **Previous Reasoning Steps** to continue reasoning for the original question.\n\n**Guidelines:**\n\n1. **Analyze the Searched Web Pages:**\n- Carefully review the content of each searched web page.\n- Identify factual information that is relevant to the **Current Search Query** and can aid in the reasoning process for the original question.\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Information:**\n- Select the information from the Searched Web Pages that directly contributes to advancing the **Previous Reasoning Steps**.\n- Ensure that the extracted information is accurate and relevant.\n\n3. **Output Format:**\n- Present the helpful information for current search query: beginning with `**Final Information**` as shown below.\n**Final Information**\n\n[Helpful information]\n\n**Inputs:**\n- **Previous Reasoning Steps:**  \nStep 1: To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:\n\n...\n\nStep 5: <|begin_search_query|> oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue with Regression label on GitHub <|end_search_query|>\n\nStep 6: <|begin_search_result|>The oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue with the "Regression" label on GitHub appears to be **Issue #5354** titled "clipping complex array crashes python". This issue was opened on **December 8, 2014**, and closed. While the label "Regression" is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, the issue references a test case added to `test_regression.py`, which strongly implies it is related to regression testing. The next relevant issue, **#9533** (opened August 8, 2017), does not mention the "Regression" label in its context. Thus, Issue #5354 is the oldest candidate based on available data. **Key Details from Web Page 4 (Issue #5354):**- **Title:** "clipping complex array crashes python"- **Opened Date:** December 8, 2014- **Context:** Mentions adding a test case to `test_regression.py`, suggesting a regression-related fix.- **Status:** Closed (exact close date not specified in snippet). This is the most plausible match given the search constraints.<|end_search_result|>\n\nStep 7: Now, we need to find when Regression was added to this issue.\n\nStep 8: <|begin_search_query|> when was Regression label added to numpy.polynomial issue #5354 on GitHub <|end_search_query|>\n\n- **Current Search Query:**  \nwhen was Regression label added to numpy.polynomial issue #5354 on GitHub\n\n- **Searched Web Pages:**  \n**Web Page 1:**\n{\n  "id": 1,\n  "title": "clipping complex array crashes python · Issue #5354 - GitHub",\n  "url": "https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/5354",\n  "site_name": "",\n  "date": "",\n  "snippet": "numpy#5354 Added testcase for clip-fft in the test_regression.py ...

{'role': 'user', 'content': '**Task Instruction:**\n\nYou are tasked with reading and analyzing web pages based on the following inputs: **Previous Reasoning Steps**, **Current Search Query**, and **Searched Web Pages**. Your objective is to extract relevant and helpful information for **Current Search Query** from the **Searched Web Pages** and seamlessly integrate this information into the **Previous Reasoning Steps** to continue reasoning for the original question.\n\n**Guidelines:**\n\n1. **Analyze the Searched Web Pages:**\n- Carefully review the content of each searched web page.\n- Identify factual information that is relevant to the **Current Search Query** and can aid in the reasoning process for the original question.\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Information:**\n- Select the information from the Searched Web Pages that directly contributes to advancing the **Previous Reasoning Steps**.\n- Ensure that the extracted information is accurate and relevant.\n\n3. **Output Format:**\n- Present the helpful information for current search query: beginning with `**Final Information**` as shown below.\n**Final Information**\n\n[Helpful information]\n\n**Inputs:**\n- **Previous Reasoning Steps:**  \nStep 1: To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:\n\n...\n\nStep 6: <|begin_search_query|> authors of the paper "Pie Menus or Linear Menus, Which Is Better?" in 2015 <|end_search_query|>\n\nStep 7: <|begin_search_result|>The authors of the 2015 paper *"Pie Menus or Linear Menus, Which Is Better?"* are **Pietro Murano** and **Iram N. Khan**. This is confirmed by multiple sources:  1. **Web Page 2** explicitly lists the authors as "Pietro Murano, 2 Iram N. Khan" in the abstract and mentions their affiliations.  2. **Web Page 7** directly states the authors are **Pietro Murano** and **I. N. Khan**.  3. **Web Page 9** (Google Scholar) cites the paper with authors "P Murano, IN Khan," aligning with the names from other sources.  These authors are consistently referenced across the searched web pages, confirming their roles in the publication.<|end_search_result|>\n\n...\n\nStep 10: <|begin_search_query|> Pietro Murano first paper before 2015 <|end_search_query|>\n\nStep 11: <|begin_search_result|>The first paper authored by Pietro Murano before 2015 is **"A new software agent\'learning\'algorithm"** published in **2001**. This is identified from **Web Page 8 (Google Scholar)**, which lists his publications chronologically. The paper was presented at the *2001 People in Control. The Second International Conference on Human...* and is the earliest work cited in his academic record. Subsequent papers from 2006 onward, such as *"Why anthropomorphic user interface feedback can be effective and preferred by users"* (2006), are also listed but come after the 2001 publication. **Key Supporting Evidence:**  - **Web Page 8 (Google Scholar):** Explicitly cites the 2001 paper as one of Pietro Murano\'s earliest works, confirming it as his first paper before 2015.  - **Web Page 1 (Publications List):** Lists his works starting from 2007 but does not contradict the 2001 paper\'s precedence.  This information advances the previous reasoning steps by identifying the earliest known paper authored by Pietro Murano prior to 2015.<|end_search_result|>\n\nStep 12: Now, let\'s search for Iram N. Khan\'s first paper before 2015.\n\nStep 13: <|begin_search_query|> Iram N. Khan first paper before 2015 <|end_search_query|>\n\n- **Current Search Query:**  \nIram N.

Identifying the problem, forming the question, and selecting an appropriate methodology and design are some of the initial challenges that researchers encounter in the early stages of any research project. These problems are particularly common for novices. Materials and Methods: This article describes the practical challenges of using qualitative inquiry in the field of health and the challenges of performing an interpretive research based on professional experience as a qualitative researcher and on available literature. Results: One of the main topics discussed is the nature of qualitative research, its inherent challenges, and how to overcome them. Some of those highlighted here include: identification of the research problem, formation of the research question/aim, and selecting an appropriate methodology and research design, which are the main concerns of qualitative researchers and need to be handled properly. Insights from real-life experiences in conducting qualitative research in health reveal these issues. Conclusions: The paper provides personal comments on the experiences of a researcher in conducting pure qualitative research in the field of health. It offers insights into the practical difficulties encountered when performing qualitative studies and offers solutions and alternatives applied by these authors, which may be of use to others. Keywords: Methodological challenges, qualitative research, research methods I NTRODUCTION Health services and health policy research can be based on qualitative research methods, especially when they deal with a rapid change and develop a more fully integrated theory base and research agenda. However, the field must be with the best traditions and techniques of qualitative methods and should distinguish the essentiality of special training and experience in applying these methods.[ 1 ] Qualitative research methodologies could help improve our understanding of health-related phenomena. Health knowledge must also include interpretive action to maintain scientific quality when research methods are applied. Qualitative and quantitative strategies should be seen as complementary rather than being thought of as incompatible. Although the procedures of interpreting texts are different from those of statistical analysis, due to their different type of data and questions to be answered, the underlying scientific principles are very much the same.[ 2 ] While working for more than a decade as qualitative designer, Khankeh faced a lot of challenges in conducting qualitative research in the field of health which occupied the mind of other health researchers. Therefore, this article contributes to the discussion of challenges related to qualitative research in healthcare in the light of personal experiences of a researcher conducting purely qualitative health research. A M AIN I SSUE FOR THE Q UALITATIVE R ESEARCHER Qualitative research methods involve systematic collection, organizing, and interpretation of material in textual form derived from talk or observations. They are useful to explore the meanings of social phenomena as experienced by individuals in their natural context. The health community still looks at qualitative research with skepticism and accuses it for the subjective nature and absence of facts. Scientific standards, criteria and checklists do exist and the adequacy of guidelines has been vigorously debated within this cross-disciplinary field.[ 2 ] Clinical knowledge consists of interpretive action and intera"\n}\n**Web Page 4:**\n{\n  "id": 4,\n  "title": "Ilkhanate - Wikipedia",\n  "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilkhanate",\n  "site_name": "",\n  "date": "",\n  "snippet": "The Ilkhanate or Il-khanate was a Mongol khanate founded in the southwestern territories of the Mongol Empire.

It was ruled by the Il-Khans or Ilkhanids ( Persian : ایلخانان , romanized : Īlkhānān ), and known to the Mongols as Hülegü Ulus ( lit. \' people / state of Hülegü \' ). [ 10 ] The Ilkhanid realm was officially known as the Land of Iran or simply Iran . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] It was established after Hülegü , the son of Tolui and grandson of Genghis Khan , inherited the West Asian and Central Asian part of the Mongol Empire after his brother Möngke Khan died in 1259. The Ilkhanate\'s core territory was situated in what is now the countries of Iran , Azerbaijan , and Turkey . At its greatest extent, the Ilkhanate also included parts of modern Iraq , Syria , Armenia , Georgia , Afghanistan , Turkmenistan , Pakistan , Tajikistan , and Dagestan ( Russia ). Later Ilkhanid rulers, beginning with Ghazan in 1295, converted to Islam . In the 1330s, the Ilkhanate was ravaged by the Black Death . The last ilkhan, Abu Sa\'id Bahadur Khan , died in 1335, after which the Ilkhanate disintegrated. The State of the Ilkhanate was known as the Ulus of Hülegü to the Mongols during that time, as their territory was derived from one of uluses allocated to Genghis (Chinggis) Khan\'s descendants. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The Ilkhanid rulers, although of non-Iranian origin, tried to advertise their authority by tying themselves to the Iranian past, and they recruited historians to present the Mongols as heirs to the Sasanian Empire (224–651). [ 15 ] Native intellectuals interested in their own history interpreted the unification by the Mongols as a revival of their long-lost dynastic tradition, and the concept of \\"Land of Iran\\" ( Irān-zamin ) was considered an important ideology and was further developed by the later Safavid Empire (1501–1736). Similar to the development in China under the Yuan dynasty , the revival of the concept of territorial unity, although not intended by the Mongols, became a lasting legacy of Mongol rule in Iran. [ 16 ] History [ edit ] See also: Timeline of the Ilkhanate Origin [ edit ] When Muhammad II of Khwarazm ordered a contingent of merchants, dispatched by the Mongols, to be killed, Genghis Khan declared war on the Anushtegin dynasty in 1219. The Mongols overran the empire , occupying the major cities and population centers between 1219 and 1221. Iran was ravaged by the Mongol detachment under Jebe and Subutai , who left the area in ruin. Transoxiana also came under Mongol control after the invasion. [ 17 ] Muhammad II\'s son Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu returned to Iran in c. 1224 after fleeing to India. The rival Turkic states, which were all that remained of his father\'s empire, quickly declared their allegiance to Jalal. He repulsed the first Mongol attempt to take Central Persia. However, Jalal ad-Din was overwhelmed and crushed by Chormaqan \'s army sent by the Great Khan Ögedei in 1231. During the Mongol expedition, Azerbaijan and the southern Persian dynasties in Fars and Kerman voluntarily submitted to the Mongols and agreed to pay tribute.

Moreover, most of the currently evaluated project criteria models are Project success is a problematic synopsis because usually based on qualitative and subjective opinions * of its complexity (Joslin and Müller, 2015; Todorović of evaluators, resulting in inappropriate decisions et al., 2015). Until now, there is no accepted (Nguyen et al., 2017b). Also, these models ignore the universal definition of project success. It depends on risk factors and the importance of assessors (Quyen human perceptions, and it has been discussed for a et al., 2017a; 2017b). To overcome these limitations, long time by many authors (Abdullah et al., 2015; our paper uses a multi-attribute decision analysis Shaari et al., 2015). It may vary depending on many method for based on Analytical Hierarchy Process factors and stakeholders point of views (Chan et al., (fuzzy-AHP) in project success criteria evaluation. 2004). For example, a construction project engineer may consider success regarding quality and cost 2. Research background aspect, but an architect may refer to project aesthetic appearance (Nguyen et al., 2015; 2017a). According to Oxford Advanced Learner’s Evaluating the success of the engineering project Dictionary, criterion means “a standard or principle is essential. In the construction industry, for by which something is judged, or with the help of example, project success definition varies among which a decision is made.” However, the definition of different projects depending on participants, project a factor is “one or several things that cause or size, scope and time constraint to implement a influence something.” So, the concept of “project project (Iram et al., 2017; Oke and Aigbavboa, 2017; success criteria” and “project success factor” are Nguyen and Nguyen, 2017).

Prior to that, Iran had been engaged in efforts to acquire the capability to build nuclear weapons for more than two decades. Although it remained uncertain whether Tehran would have made the final decision to build nuclear weapons, it had developed a range of technologies, including uranium enrichment, warhead design, and delivery systems, that would give it this option in a relatively short time frame.\xa0Tehran maintains that its nuclear activities are entirely peaceful. What follows is a chronological recount of the most significant developments in Iran’s nuclear program, international efforts to negotiate a settlement to address this controversial issue, and implementation of the agreement reached by Iran and the P5+1 on July 14, 2015.

Iranian nuclear projects are halted. 1980s January 19, 1984 : The U.S. Department of State adds Iran to its list of state sponsors of terrorism, effectively imposing sweeping sanctions on Tehran. 1987 : Iran acquires technical schematics for building a P-1 centrifuge from the Abdul Qadeer Khan network. 1990s 1992 : Congress passes the Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act of 1992, which prohibits the transfer of controlled goods or technology that might contribute “knowingly and materially” to Iran’s proliferation of advanced conventional weapons. 1993 : Conversion of the TRR is completed by Argentina’s Applied Research Institute. It now runs on fuel enriched to just less than 20 percent, 115 kilograms of which is provided by Argentina; the contract for the conversion was signed in 1987.

PMC Copyright notice PMCID: PMC5241505\xa0\xa0PMID: 28367411 Abstract Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by central\\nnervous system (CNS) lesions that can lead to severe physical or cognitive disability as well as neurological defects. Although the etiology and pathogenesis of MS\\nremains unclear, the present documents illustrate that the cause of MS is multifactorial and include genetic predisposition together with environmental factors such as\\nexposure to infectious agents, vitamin deficiencies, and smoking. These agents are\\nable to trigger a cascade of events in the immune system which lead to neuronal cell\\ndeath accompanied by nerve demyelination and neuronal dysfunction. Conventional\\ntherapies for MS are based on the use of anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory\\ndrugs, but these treatments are not able to stop the destruction of nerve tissue. Thus,\\nother strategies such as stem cell transplantation have been proposed for the treatment of MS.\\nOverall, it is important that neurologists be aware of current information regarding the\\npathogenesis, etiology, diagnostic criteria, and treatment of MS. Thus, this issue has been\\ndiscussed according to recent available information. Keywords: Multiple Sclerosis, Cell Therapy, Etiology, Demyelination Introduction Multiple sclerosis (MS), the most prevalent\\nneurological disability, is an autoimmune-mediated disorder that affects the central nervous system (CNS) and often leads to severe physical or\\ncognitive incapacitation as well as neurological\\nproblems in young adults ( 1 ). Multifocal zones\\nof inflammation due to focal T-lymphocytic and\\nmacrophage infiltrations, and oligodendrocyte\\ndeath are the primary causes of myelin sheath de-\\nstruction ( 2 ) that result in the formation of CNS\\nplaques composed of inflammatory cells and their\\nproducts, demyelinated and transected axons, and\\nastrogliosis in both white and gray matter. These\\nlesions can cross-talk with the correct transmission\\nof nerve impulses and lead to neuronal dysfunction such as autonomic and sensorimotor defects,\\nvisual disturbances, ataxia, fatigue, difficulties in\\nthinking, and emotional problems ( 1 ). Subtypes of MS are considered important not\\nonly for prognosis but also for treatment decisions\\nand include: relapsing remitting MS (RRMS), primary progressive MS (PPMS), secondary progressive MS (SPMS), and progressive relapsing MS\\n(PRMS). RRMS is the most common subtype (approximately 87%) which characterized by unpre-\\ndictable acute attacks followed by periods of remission ( 3 ). During RRMS, inflammatory attacks\\non myelin and nerve fibers occur. Activated immune cells cause lesions in the CNS which generate symptoms of visual impairments, tingling and\\nnumbness, episodic bouts of fatigue, intestinal and\\nurinary system disorders, spasticity, and learning\\nand memory impairment. Approximately 10-15%\\nof MS patients are diagnosed with PPMS which largely affect the nerves of the spinal cord. PPMS patients tend to have fewer brain lesions.\\nInduced symptoms include problems with walking, weakness, stiffness, and trouble with balance. Nearly 65% of patients\\nwith RRMS will subsequently develop SPMS which\\nis considered the second phase of this disease.

There’s a certain species of fish that was popularized as a pet by being the main character of the movie Finding Nemo. According to the USGS, where was this fish found as a nonnative species, before the year 2020? I need the answer formatted as the five-digit zip codes of the places the species was found, separated by commas if there is more than one place. false true true true true true # Report: Nonnative Sightings of Amphiprion ocellaris (Clownfish) in the United States Before 2020\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nThe clownfish (*Amphiprion ocellaris*), popularized by the movie *Finding Nemo*, has become a widely recognized species in the aquarium trade. Its popularity as a pet has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive when released into nonnative environments. This report investigates the nonnative sightings of *Amphiprion ocellaris* in the United States before 2020, as documented by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The findings are presented in the form of five-digit zip codes, as requested.\\n\\n## Methodology\\n\\nThe research process involved analyzing data from the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database and other credible sources. The focus was on identifying specific locations where *Amphiprion ocellaris* was reported as a nonnative species before 2020. The data was cross-referenced with geographic identifiers to extract zip codes. Additionally, the reliability and relevance of the sources were evaluated to ensure the accuracy of the findings.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Findings\\n\\n### 1. **Nonnative Sightings of Amphiprion ocellaris**\\n\\nThe USGS NAS database documented a single confirmed nonnative sighting of *Amphiprion ocellaris* in the United States before 2020. This sighting occurred in **Fred Howard Park**, located in Pinellas County, Florida, in July 2018. The specimen was removed and transferred to the Clearwater Marine Aquarium, and the population was declared eradicated ([clown anemonefish (Amphiprion ocellaris) - Species Profile](<url-1>); [Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database](<url-2>)).\\n\\n#### Geographic Details:\\n- **Location:** Fred Howard Park, Pinellas County, Florida\\n- **Zip Code:** 34689 ([Fred Howard Park in Tarpon Springs](<url-9>))\\n\\nThis is the only documented nonnative occurrence of *Amphiprion ocellaris* in the USGS database before 2020.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. **Ecological Context and Introduction Pathway**\\n\\n#### Ecological Impact:\\nThe ecological impact of *Amphiprion ocellaris* as a nonnative species remains unknown due to the limited number of sightings and lack of long-term studies. The species is known for its symbiotic relationship with sea anemones, which provides it with protection from predators. However, the introduction of *Amphiprion ocellaris* into nonnative environments could potentially disrupt local ecosystems, particularly if it establishes a population ([clown anemonefish (Amphiprion ocellaris)](<url-3>)).\\n\\n#### Means of Introduction:\\nThe primary pathway for the introduction of *Amphiprion ocellaris* into nonnative environments is through aquarium releases. The popularity of the species in the pet trade, driven by its association with *Finding Nemo*, has led to concerns about irresponsible pet ownership and the release of unwanted fish into the wild ([Real clownfish suffered after \'Finding Nemo,\' so \'Finding Dory\' raises concerns](<url-5>)).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. **Analysis of Data Sources**\\n\\n#### Reliability of USGS Data:\\nThe USGS NAS database is a credible and authoritative source for tracking nonnative species in the United States. The data is peer-reviewed and regularly updated, ensuring high reliability. However, the database does not explicitly list zip codes for nonnative occurrences, requiring additional geographic interpretation ([Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database](<url-2>)).\\n\\n#### Limitations:\\n- The USGS database documented only one nonnative sighting of *Amphiprion ocellaris* before 2020, suggesting limited spread or reporting of the species.\\n- The absence of studies on the ecological impact of *Amphiprion ocellaris* in nonnative environments highlights a gap in research.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. **Summary Table of Findings**\\n\\n| **Location**         | **State** | **County**       | **Year** | **Zip Code** | **Status**   |\\n|-----------------------|-----------|------------------|----------|--------------|--------------|\\n| Fred Howard Park      | Florida   | Pinellas County  | 2018     | 34689        | Eradicated   |\\n\\n*Note: The data represents the only documented nonnative sighting of *Amphiprion ocellaris* in the United States before 2020.*\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe research confirms that *Amphiprion ocellaris* was found as a nonnative species in the United States before 2020 at Fred Howard Park in Pinellas County, Florida. The corresponding zip code for this location is **34689**. The species was introduced through aquarium releases and subsequently rem"\n}\n**Web Page 10:**\n{\n  "id": 10,\n  "title": "[PDF] THE IRANIAN NUCLEAR ISSUE AND REGIONAL SECURITY",\n  "url": "https://hr.un.org/sites/hr.un.org/files/The%20Iranian%20Nuclear%20Issue%20and%20Regional%20Security.pdf",\n  "site_name": "",\n  "date": "",\n  "snippet": "Iran\'s nuclear programme started in 1957 as part of US President Eisenhower\'s “Atoms for Peace” initiative aimed at balancing fears of continuing nuclear ...",\n  "context": "SABBATICAL LEAVE REPORT Department of Political Affairs, Middle East and West Asia Division Xiaoning Huang THE IRANIAN NUCLEAR ISSUE AND REGIONAL SECURITY: DILEMMAS, RESPONSES AND THE FUTURE July 2016 Disclaimer: The views expressed in this paper are solely those of the author and do not represent the official positions of the United Nations.Acknowledgements During my sabbatical leave from 18 January 2016 to 16 May 2016, I conducted research on the Iranian nuclear issue and regional security at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA). I am grateful to SIPA’s Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies (SIWPS) for hosting me as a visiting scholar. The enormous resources and expertise at Columbia and SIPA have been extremely helpful to my research. Professor Stuart Gottlieb, my academic advisor, guided me on designing the research and concentrating on the most relevant aspects. Professor Gary Sick kindly permitted me to audit his course on the US Foreign Policy and the Persian Gulf, which provided a comprehensive survey of major events in the Gulf region since the late 1960s. I also benefited from discussions with other scholars at SIPA, including Professors Austin Long and Richard Nephew, as well as participants in my presentation at SIPA on the main findings of this research on 21 April 2016. I wish to also thank the United Nations sabbatical leave programme for offering me the opportunity to spend four months studying an issue that has been high on the UN’s peace and security agenda. My appreciations go particularly to colleagues at the Middle East and West Asia Division of the Department of Political Affairs for taking over my work portfolios in my absence and to my supervisors for allowing me to take the leave at a busy time. Several colleagues at the UN reviewed earlier versions of this paper and provided useful comments, to which I am grateful. 1Executive Summary The Iranian nuclear issue has been one of the most contentious international conflicts in recent decades. This protracted crisis has increased tensions in the region and beyond, presenting a dilemma to all involved, including Iran itself, the P5+1 (China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States), the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries (particularly Saudi Arabia) and Israel. Due to imperfect information, particularly a lack of understanding of each other’s intentions and calculations, numerous actions and counteractions have been made at the international, regional and national levels to address the perceived Iranian nuclear threat. In the end, despite strong objections by some elements in Tehran and Washington as well as by Israel and Saudi Arabia, the P5+1 and Iran reached a long-term, comprehensive deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Whether the deal will hold for its duration remains unclear, but many uncertainties, including those related to domestic politics in Iran and the US, will certainly affect its full implementation. It is widely hoped that a diplomatic resolution of the Iranian nuclear issue will eventually usher in an era of greater cooperation between Iran and the West, as well as among the countries in the Gulf region. Nevertheless, there are fears that the JCPOA, by addressing the nuclear issue only and not dealing with non-nuclear concerns about Iran, may increase tensions in the region in the short-to-medium term. A regional security framework that takes into account both the nuclear and non-nuclear concerns of all players is therefore urgently required for a sustainable resolution of the nuclear issue and lasting peace in the region. Although such a framework is unlikely to be achieved under current circumstances, especially while the wars in Syria and"\n}\n\n\nNow you should analyze each web page and find helpful information based on the current search query "Iram N.
