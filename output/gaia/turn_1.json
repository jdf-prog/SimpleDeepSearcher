The regal blue tang can be found throughout the Indo-Pacific. It is seen in the reefs of the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan, the Great Barrier ...\",\n  \"context\": \"acific surgeonfish . A popular fish in marine aquaria , it is the only member of the genus Paracanthurus . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] A number of common names are attributed to the species, including regal tang , palette surgeonfish , blue tang (leading to confusion with the Atlantic species Acanthurus coeruleus ), royal blue tang , hippo tang , blue hippo tang , flagtail surgeonfish , Pacific regal blue tang , and blue surgeonfish , hepatus tang , Indo-Pacific blue tang , regal blue surgeonfish , wedge-tailed tang , wedgetail blue tang . [ 4 ] It is most closely related to genus Zebrasoma , with which it forms a sister group. [ 5 ] Description [ edit ] Young juvenile, in Indonesia Paracanthurus hepatus has a royal blue body, yellow tail, and black \\\"palette\\\" design. Its length at first sexual maturity is 149.2 mm. [ 6 ] Adults typically weigh around 600 g (21 oz) and males are generally larger than females. [ 7 ] The back has a broad black area that encloses at the tip of the pectoral , creating a blue oval on each side of the fish that extends in the direction of the eye. [ 8 ] The tail has a bright yellow triangle with its apex anterior to the caudal spine and its base at the posterior end of the caudal fin . Black surrounds the triangle on the upper and lower lobes of the caudal fin, in the same hue as the back area. [ 8 ] Paracanthurus has small small scales , each with short ctenii on the upper surface. [ 8 ] Scales on the caudal spine possess ctenii approximately three times as long as scales on the rest of the body. Scales anteriorly placed on the head between the eye and the upper jaw are larger with tuberculated, bony plates. [ 9 ] [ 8 ] With fins fully extended This fish has a compressed, elliptical body shape, and a terminal snout. [ 8 ] It has nine dorsal spines, 26–28 dorsal soft rays, three anal spines, and 24–26 anal soft yellow rays, and 16 principal caudal rays with slightly projecting upper and lower lobes. [ 8 ] Its pelvic fin is made up of one spine and three rays; this characteristic is considered a synapomorphy of the Naso and Paracanthurus genus. [ 9 ] The caudal peduncle has a spine located in a shallow groove, which is also a characteristic of its sister taxa Zebrasoma . [ 9 ] It has 22 vertebrae. [ 8 ] Paracanthurus has teeth that are small, close-set, denticulated, [ 8 ] and described as incisor-like. [ 9 ] Jaw morphology includes an ectopterygoid that links the palatine to the quadrate near the articular condyle. [ 9 ] A crest is present on the anterodorsal surface of the hyomandibular . The opercle is less developed, with a distinctly convex profile. [ 9 ] Some slight variation in appearance is present within Paracanthurus . [ 10 ] The lower body is yellow in west-central Indian Ocean [ 11 ] individuals, and bluish in Pacific individuals (4). Additionally, the blue color on the trunk of Paracanthurus loses pigmentation in response to changes in light and/or melatonin levels, making its appearance slightly lighter in color at night. [ 10 ] Distribution [ edit ] The regal blue tang can be found throughout the Indo-Pacific . It is seen in the reefs of the Philippines , Indonesia , Japan , the Great Barrier Reef of Australia, New Caledonia , Samoa , East Africa , and Sri Lanka . [ 12 ] [ 2 ] A single specimen was photographed in 2015 in the Mediterranean Sea off Israel. [ 13 ] Vagrants were found two separate occasions in Hawaii, and are assumed to be aquarium releases. [ 4 ] Paracanthurus is an extant resident in the following territories: American Samoa; Australia; British Indian Ocean Territory; Brunei Darussalam; Christmas Island; Cocos (Keeling) Islands; Comoros; Cook Islands; Disputed Territory (Paracel Is., Spratly Is.); Fiji; French Southern Territories (Mozambique Channel Is.); Guam; India (Nicobar Is., Andaman Is.); Indonesia; Japan; Kenya; Kiribati (Kiribati Line Is., Phoenix Is., Gilbert Is.); Madagascar; Malaysia; Maldives; Marshall Islands; Mauritius; Mayotte; Micronesia, Federated States of ; Myanmar; Nauru; New Caledonia; Niue; Northern Mariana Islands; Palau; Papua New Guinea; Philippines; Réunion; Samoa; Seychelles; Singapore; Solomon Islands; Somalia; South Africa; Sri Lanka; Taiwan, Province of China; Tanzania, United Republic of; Thailand; Timor-Leste; Tokelau; Tonga; Tuvalu; United States (Hawaiian Is.); United States Minor Outlying Islands (US Line Is., Howland-Baker Is.); Vanuatu; Viet Nam; Wallis and Futuna. [ 4 ] Ecology [ edit ] Paracanthurus is a diurnal [ 10 ] marine species that occupies marine neritic habitats along coastlines. [ 14 ] It is found in clear water on exposed outer reef areas or in channels with a moderate or strong current. [ 4 ] It primarily utilizes coral reef habitats, but is also known to utilize seagrass beds, mangroves, algal beds, and rocky reefs [1]. It has an upper and lower depth limit of 2 meters and 40 meters, respectively . [ 4 ] They live in pairs or small groups of 8 to 14 individuals. They can also be found near cauliflower corals on the seaweed side of coral reefs. Juveniles can be found in schools using Acropora for shelter. Numbers of males and females tend to maintain a 1:1 ratio. [ 6 ] The fish is important for coral health as it eats algae that may otherwise choke it by overgrowth. [ 15 ] Diet [ edit ] As a juvenile, its diet consists primarily of plankton . Adults are omnivorous and feed on zooplankton , but will also graze on filamentous algae . [ 16 ] Life cycle [ edit ] Juveniles Spawning takes place year round, with a peak between April and September. [ 6 ] Spawning occurs during late afternoon and evening hours around outer reef slopes. [ 4 ] This event is indicated by a change in color from a uniform dark blue to a pale blue. Males aggressively court female members of the school, leading to a quick upward spawning rush toward the surface of the water during which eggs and sperm are released. The eggs are small, approximately 0.8 millimetres ( 1 ⁄ 32 in) in diameter. The eggs are pelagic , each containing a single droplet of oil for flotation. The fertilized eggs hatch in twenty-four hours, reve\"\n}\n**Web Page 2:**\n{\n  \"id\": 2,\n  \"title\": \"Blue Tang – Discover Fishes - Florida Museum of Natural History\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/discover-fish/species-profiles/blue-tang/\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"The blue tang is found in the western Atlantic Ocean from New York and Bermuda to the Gulf of Mexico, south to Brazil.

Photo © John Soward Acanthurus coeruleus This oval-shaped tropical reef fish is a popular aquarium and bait fish that has three color phases of its life. It isn’t often consumed because of the strong odor and chance of ciguaterra poisoning. Handle with care if catching because of the sharp spine hidden in the caudal peduncle (narrow area just before the tail). These vegetarians play an important role on the reefs by eating the algae that can grow over the coral and kill it. Order – Perciformes Family – Acanthuridae Genus – Acanthurus Species – coeruleus Common Names English common names include blue tang , blue barber, blue doctor, blue doctorfish, blue tang surgeonfish, blur tang, yellow barber, and yellow doctorfish. Other names are barbeiro (Portuguese), barbero (Spanish), barbero azul (Spanish), chirurgien bayolle (French), chirurgien bleu (French), cirujano (Spanish), doctor (Spanish), medico (Spanish), navajon azul (Spanish), pokolec turkusowy (Polish), sangrador azul (Spanish), and siwizye (Creole). Importance to Humans Blue tangs and sea fan. Photo courtesy NOAA The blue tang is of minor commercial fisheries importance, however it is occasionally utilized as a bait fish. The flesh has a strong odor and is not highly prized. This fish may cause ciguaterra poisoning if consumed by humans. However, blue tangs are collected commercially for the aquarium trade. An unwary human who tries to handle the blue tang risks the chances of being badly cut by the caudal spine. These spines, on both sides of the caudal peduncle, are extended from the body when the fish becomes excited. The quick, thrashing sideways motion of the tail can produce deep wounds that result in swelling and discoloration, posing a high risk of infection. The pain can last for hours, until eventually subsiding into a dull ache. It is believed that some species of Acathurus have venom glands while others do not. The spines are used only as a method of protection against aggressors. Conservation > Check the status of the blue tang at the IUCN website . The IUCN is a global union of states, governmental agencies, and non-governmental organizations in a partnership that assesses the conservation status of species. World distribution map for the blue tang Geographical Distribution The blue tang is found in the western Atlantic Ocean from New York and Bermuda to the Gulf of Mexico, south to Brazil. It is abundant in Florida, Bahamas, and the Caribbean Sea. In the eastern Atlantic Ocean it occurs near Ascension Island. Habitat Blue tangs schooling over rocky coral reef. Photo courtesy NOAA Tangs are found in coral reefs and inshore grassy or rocky areas at depths of 6-131 feet (2-40 m). In coral reefs, blue tangs live in holes and crevices where they are sheltered from predators while they sleep at night. The blue tang lives singly, in pairs, or in small groups of up to 10 or 12 individuals, although occasionally it forms large aggregations that forage about the shallow reefs, grazing on algae. These aggregations sometimes include doctorfish ( Acanthurus chirurgus ) and other surgeonfish. The juvenile blue tang is rarely seen on the reef due to its small size and need for constant cover from predators. The intermediate phase with the blue body and yellow tail is often observed on reefs while young adults are abundant everywhere on the reef. Biology Juvenile blue tang with yellow coloration. Photo © Doug Perrine Distinctive Features The blue tang is a high-bodied, compressed, pancake-shaped fish with a pointed snout and small scales. The eye is located high on the head and the mouth is small and low on the head. The dorsal fin is continuous. Of particular interest is the distinct yellow caudal spine located at the base of the tail on either side of the body, a characteristic shared with other surgeonfish. This spine fits into a horizontal groove and can be extended and used to fend off aggressive encounters. Coloration This fish has three color phases. In its juvenile phase, it is bright yellow, changing to a mixture of yellow and blue during adolescence. There may be blue crescents above and below the pupils of the eyes. It may be spotted with blue or have a yellow body and blue fins. Juvenile blue tang. Photo © Keri Wilk As the fish matures into the intermediate phase, the color darkens to a bright blue or purplish-gray with a yellow caudal fin. Gray longitudinal lines are located in the flank region with blue dorsal and anal fins banded with orange-brown diagonal lines. The caudal spine is yellow to pale yellow or white. At night, blue tangs display white vertical stripes. Adult blue tangs are deep blue to purplish-blue with a yellow caudal spine. The change from juvenile to intermediate to adult coloration is not size-dependent as some fish in the juvenile yellow phase may be larger than the adult blue phase. Blue tang. Photo © David Snyder Dentition The close-set, spatulate teeth of the blue tang are well adapted for nipping, grazing, and browsing algae from the reef. There are 14 teeth on the upper jaw and 16 teeth on the lower jaw. Size, Age, and Growth The blue tang reaches approximately 12 inches (30.5 cm) in length. The largest specimen, caught off the coast of South America, measured 14.4 inches (37 cm). It reaches sexual maturity at 9-12 months of age and lengths of 4-5 inches (11-13 cm).

Paracanthurus hepatus (palette surgeonfish) Marine Fishes Exotic Collection Info Point Map Species Profile Animated Map Paracanthurus hepatus Linnaeus, 1766 Common name: palette surgeonfish Synonyms and Other Names: hippo tang, Pacific blue tang, regal tang Taxonomy: available through www.itis.gov Identification: Randall (2002) describes the palette surgeonfish as having an elongate body with a truncate caudal fin. It is a striking blue color with a black band curving upward from the eye, broadening on the body, continuing to the full width of the caudal peduncle. The body contains a large elliptical blue area centered above the tip of the pectoral fin. The caudal fin is yellow with broad black upper and lower margins. The yellow extends forward to enclose the single folding spine on the caudal peduncle. Size: This species can reach a total length of 31 cm (Myers 1999). Native Range: Palette surgeon fish are native to the Pacific and Indian oceans from East Africa to Indonesia, Micronesia, Samoa, New Caledonia and Line Islands and from southwest Japan to the Great Barrier Reef (Allen et al 2003).

State First Observed Last Observed Total HUCs with observations† HUCs with observations† FL 2020 2020 1 Florida Southeast Coast Table last updated 8/12/2025 † Populations may not be currently present. Ecology: The palette surgeonfish is found in loose aggregations on the exposed edges of outer reefs in flowing current 2 to 40 m deep (Myer 1999, Randall 2002). When frightened individuals may wedge themselves among coral branches for shelter (Myers 1999). The species feeds on zooplankton and benthic algae (Randall 2002). Surgeonfishes get their common name from their ability to slash other fishes with their sharp caudal spine. In addition to the sharp caudal spine, the palette surgeon fish has venomous dorsal, anal, and pelvic spines (Randall et al. 1990). Means of Introduction: Probable aquarium release. Status: Unknown Impact of Introduction: The impacts of this species are currently unknown, as no studies have been done to determine how it has affected ecosystems in the invaded range. The absence of data does not equate to lack of effects. It does, however, mean that research is required to evaluate effects before conclusions can be made.

This photo of a blue tang clearly shows the caudal spine, yellow, slightly extended near the fish’s tail. Photograph by DerHans04, courtesy Wikimedia. CC-BY-SA-3.0,2.5,2.0,1.0 Discussion Ideas 1. Blue tangs aren’t always blue, and they’re not always tangs. Juvenile blue tangs are bright yellow. And adult blue tangs can actually modulate their color based on environmental conditions. Under stress, for example, their blue coloration deepens to violet and the black marks may become slightly bleached. Blue tangs get their color from cells called iridiphores, a type of chromatophore . Iridiphores are crystal structures of guanine (the famous G in our DNA tetrarchy of guanine, cytosine, adenine, and thymine). The crystalline arrangement reflects light at a specific spectrum and determines the animal’s color. Dory’s species of blue tang, Paracanthurus hepatus , has many different names: blue tang, doctorfish, common surgeon, regal tang, palette surgeonfish, royal blue tang, hippo tang, flagtail surgeonfish, Pacific regal blue tang, and blue surgeonfish. Paracanthurus hepatus is often confused with Acanthurus leucosternon and Acanthurus coeruleus . The three fish look very different, but are all known as blue tang—be careful when you’re researching! 2. Blue tang are everywhere and nowhere. Blue tang are not listed on the IUCN list of endangered species; their populations are pretty healthy and they’re of “least concern.” However, as a nice sentence on Wikipedia notes, “the species’ range is broad, but it is common nowhere.” Blue tang are indigenous to warm, shallow tropical reefs of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Blue tang are entirely helpless when they hatch, lacking a pigments, eyes, a mouth or even a heartbeat. They drift with the currents for about five hours after hatching. 3. Blue tang are important parts of the coral reef food web . Adult blue tangs are omnivores that feed primarily on algae , but can also consume plankton . These first-order consumers keep “ algae levels on coral down to a manageable level . Without the blue tang there to eat their fill, algae could overgrow and suffocate the reefs.” Blue tangs themselves are prey for important secondary consumers such as tuna, grouper, and barracuda. 4. Blue tangs are poison. Blue tangs often carry a toxin called ciguatera . Symptoms of ciguatera poisoning are usually limited to vomiting and diarrhea, but may also include more serious symptoms such as headaches, muscle aches, and even hallucinations and heart and breathing problems. FYI: Some scientists think an outbreak of ciguatera poisoning in islands of the Malay Archipelago may have prompted the great Polynesian ocean migrations of the early 1000s. (!!!) 5. Blue tangs will cut you. As its “surgeonfish” name indicates, blue tangs are handy with scalpels . The fish have caudal spines—very sharp spines that can be extended from either side of their caudal peduncle (the area where the tail joins the body). The caudal spine contains toxins that can cause a debilitating pain to small predators and uncomfortable irritation and pain in humans. Blue tangs extend their caudal spine and thrash around when threatened. The defense mechanism is useful. Some parrotfish , which are similarly colored but lack caudal spines or toxins, often join groups of blue tang for protection. 5½. Think twice before adding a blue tang to your aquarium. Blue tangs are already some of the most popular fish in saltwater aquariums, and many scientists and businesses think Finding Dory will only increase demand . However, while the aquarium trade may help save many species of reef fish (including clownfish—Nemo!), it doesn’t bode as well for the blue tang. The reason: Blue tangs are not bred in captivity. That means they’re all caught in the wild, putting a stress on natural populations. Blue tangs can live more than 30 years in the wild. In aquariums, where they more readily acquire diseases, they generally survive about 8 to 12 years. The beautiful blue tang lives in the Ulm Zoo in Germany. Photograph by H.

They are known as surgeonfish because they can slice you with their sharp, spiny caudal fins. Adults are blue, ranging from a deep blue or even purplish to much paler blue. Surprisingly, as juveniles, Blue Tang are bright yellow. As they grow, they become blue, with the tail being the last part to lose the yellow. Blue Tang are herbivores, cruising constantly round reefs feeding on algae. They also act as cleaners of other fish species, removing parasites. They themselves may be cleaned by gobies by visiting so-called ‘cleaning stations’. These piscine beauty parlours have a medicinal purpose as well, since cleaning helps to cure minor wounds. These fish often move around reefs in large schools, as shown in the header image. Apart from having some value as an aquarium fish, they are not generally of use to humans. Their spiny caudal fins can cause a nasty wound. They have an unpleasant smell. Their flesh supposedly contains toxins, and they carrying a risk of the disease CIGUATERA . I can’t even find a recipe for them online – now, that is a bad sign, there are some people who will try anything. I guess best to boil them for an hour or two, drain the water, allow to cool, and throw away the fish. FUN FACT In the Disney/Pixar film Finding Nemo , the character Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) is a blue tang. BLUE TANG: THE MOVIE [RE-RELEASE] “RECIPE Take one incompetent swimmer who hasn’t snorkelled in, oh, nearly 40 years. Place him over a coral reef for his first time ever. Add a small underwater camera totally alien to him. Immerse for 30 minutes in warm briny water. Lessons have been learnt for next time. Mainly, don’t keep waving the camera about; let the fish move round you rather than vice versa; and most important of all, remember to keep breathing or else… Here is BLUE TANG: THE MOVIE (music by Adrian Legg), 45 secs of advanced camera-shake with some beautiful fish more or less in shot for most of the time. If you are prone to sea-sickness, do not enlarge the video. If you are allergic to poor photography… well, thanks for visiting.” [vimeo https://vimeo.com/44794952] Credits: Good pictures, Melinda; bad pictures and execrable movie, not Melinda Share this: Click to print (Opens in new window) Print Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Reddit Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Tumblr Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Pinterest Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Pocket Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp More Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) Email Click to share on Bluesky (Opens in new window) Bluesky Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X Like Loading...

It is typically a solitary and territorial fish and is an herbivore feeding mainly on algae. Originally published: March 30, 2020 Last updated: October 29, 2024 Credit: Ken Kurtis/Aquarium of the Pacific Credit: Robin Riggs/Aquarium of the Pacific SPECIES IN DETAIL Powder Blue Tang Acanthurus leucosternon CONSERVATION STATUS: Least concern CLIMATE CHANGE: At the Aquarium The Aquarium has powder blue tangs in the Tropical Reef Habitat, Soft Coral Garden, Live Coral, and Tropical Pacific Preview exhibits in the Tropical Pacific Gallery and in Shark Lagoon’s large touch pool. Geographic Distribution Powder blue tangs are found throughout the Indian Ocean, from eastern Africa to the Andaman Sea, southwest Indonesia, and Christmas Island, into the western Pacific Ocean to Bali, Indonesia. Habitat Powder blue tangs live in clear shallow waters surrounding inshore coral reefs, specifically preferring reef flats and upper seaward slopes. Physical Characteristics The powder blue tang has an oval-shaped laterally compressed body. Its body color is vivid blue with a black head and a broad white band from pectoral fin to throat. It has a vivid yellow coloration on its dorsal fin and at the base of the caudal fin. It has white pelvic and anal fins and a crescent-shaped caudal fin. It has a small, pointed, beak-like mouth with tiny sharp teeth. It has an erected spine on each side of the caudal peduncle base. Size These fish have an average length of 7.5 to 9 inches (19 to 23 centimeters) and a maximum length of 21 inches (54 centimeters). Diet This species grazes on benthic algae, either singly or in large feeding groups. Reproduction Powder blue tangs practice monogamous (pair) spawning. Behavior This fish grazes singly or in large feeding groups. When food isn’t plentiful, it may become aggressive to other fish invading its territory. It will feed in groups if food is plentiful. Adaptation The shape of its beak-like mouth is useful for accessing algae in small crevices. Longevity In the wild powder blue tangs typically live for about five years. They can live up to ten years in an aquarium setting. Conservation The powder blue tang is listed as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Despite their name, they are not always blue; juveniles are born bright yellow and turn blue as they age. Adults have a flat blue body with a yellow tail and black palette design. The spines along the top and bottom of its body give it the name “surgeonfish.” The regal blue tang is a type of surgeon fish found throughout the Indo-Pacific waters. They inhabit clear waters in various coral reefs with lots of seaweed in pairs or small groups of up to 14 fish. The regal blue tang goes by many names such as the hippo tang, the Pacific blue tang, palette surgeonfish, blue surgeonfish, flagtail surgeonfish, and more. Regal blue tangs are important to the health of a coral reef as they eat algae that may have killed the coral. Besides eating algae, the tang’s omnivorous diet also has them eating plankton like their juvenile selves. During the breeding season, many male and female regal blue tangs will congregate. In the average spawning season, females will release 40,000 eggs in total while the males will release their sperm into the water. This increases the likelihood of fertilization and decreases the chances of the eggs being eaten by predators. The eggs will hatch in about a day and stay in plankton until they become juveniles and then develop in the coral. Regal blue tangs can be both venomous and poisonous. If they feel threatened, they can raise two sharp spines by their tail and shake their body from side to side to try to sting their attacker. The spines are tipped with a toxin that can debilitate prey and hurt humans. If eaten, regal blue tangs can cause severe stomach problems from the dinoflagellates the regal blue tangs eat.

Similar species:  No Atlantic surgeonfish is known to have stripes on the body.  However, faint body lines can be seen on the blue tang ( Acanthurus coeruleus ), which has a solid blue body and yellow scalpel. Native Range: Western Indian Ocean including the Red Sea to the Persian Gulf (Randall 1983). Interactive maps: Point Distribution Maps Nonindigenous Occurrences : In Florida , a single individual was observed off Pompano Beach in 2002 (REEF 2008). One individual was captured in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Greece in 2017 (Giovos et al. 2018).

Ecology: The preferred habitat of the Sohal surgeonfish is the outer edge of reef flats that are exposed to surge (Randall 1983).  The species grazes on Sargassum and filamentous green algae (Vine 1974; Lieske and Myers 1994).  It is known to be a very aggressive territorial species (Alwany et al. 2005). Means of Introduction: Probable aquarium release. Status: Reported from Florida. Impact of Introduction: The impacts of this species are currently unknown, as no studies have been done to determine how it has affected ecosystems in the invaded range. The absence of data does not equate to lack of effects. It does, however, mean that research is required to evaluate effects before conclusions can be made.

        "turn_1_webpage_analyses": "The blue tang (*Paracanthurus hepatus*), also known as the regal blue tang or palette surgeonfish, has been reported as a nonnative species in the following locations before 2020:  1. **Hawaii, USA**:     - Vagrant individuals were observed in Hawaiian waters, likely due to aquarium releases. These are not native to Hawaii and are considered nonindigenous.  2. **Mediterranean Sea**:     - A single specimen was photographed off the coast of Israel in 2015. Another confirmed record occurred in Greece in 2017 (though the latter is post-2015 but still before 2020).  3. **Florida, USA**:     - One fish was sighted in Palm Beach County, Florida, in February 2020. While this is very close to 2020, the observation occurred early in the year and may be considered within the timeframe.  These occurrences are attributed to aquarium releases or accidental introductions, as the species is popular in the marine aquarium trade.  **Sources**:  - Web Page 1 (Wikipedia) mentions vagrants in Hawaii from aquarium releases and the 2015 Mediterranean sighting.  - Web Page 3 (USGS NAS) documents the Florida 2020 sighting.  - Web Page 6 (ResearchGate) references Mediterranean records in 2015 and 2017.  This information integrates with the previous reasoning steps by confirming the blue tang’s nonnative presence in Hawaii, the Mediterranean, and Florida (near 2020)."

In other words, there is a 96% chance that the observed effect is real (assuming the null hypothesis is false).\n\n2. **Error Rate**: However, in scientific research, a p-value of 0.04 is often used as a threshold for statistical significance, but it does not guarantee that 96% of the time the results are correct. The p-value of 0.04 means that 4% of the time, the results could be due to random chance, even if the null hypothesis is false. This is known as a Type I error rate, which is 4% in this case.\n\n3. **Calculating the Number of Incorrect Papers**: If we assume that all articles published in Nature in 2020 relied on a p-value of 0.04 as the threshold for statistical significance, and if we assume that the null hypothesis is false for 96% of the studies (which is a reasonable assumption in many fields), then 4% of the studies would be incorrect. \n\nTo find the number of incorrect papers, we need to know the total number of articles published in Nature in 2020. Let's perform a search to find this number.\n\n<|begin_search_query|> number of articles published in nature in 2020 <|end_search_query|>\n\n<|begin_search_result|>In 2020, **1,002 articles** were published in *Nature*, as indicated by the filter for \"Article Type: Article (1002)\" on the journal's official page ([Web Page 1](#) and [Web Page 3](#)).

As a multidisciplinary publication, Nature features peer-reviewed research from a variety of academic disciplines, mainly in science and technology. It has core editorial offices across the United States, continental Europe, and Asia under the international scientific publishing company Springer Nature . Nature was one of the world's most cited scientific journals by the Science Edition of the 2022 Journal Citation Reports (with an ascribed impact factor of 50.5), [ 1 ] making it one of the world's most-read and most prestigious academic journals . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] As of 2012 [update] , it claimed an online readership of about three million unique readers per month. [ 5 ] Founded in the autumn of 1869, Nature was first circulated by Norman Lockyer and Alexander MacMillan as a public forum for scientific innovations. The mid-20th century facilitated an editorial expansion for the journal; Nature redoubled its efforts in explanatory and scientific journalism . The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the creation of a network of editorial offices outside of Britain and the establishment of ten new supplementary, speciality publications (e.g. Nature Materials ). Since the late 2000s, dedicated editorial and current affairs columns are created weekly, and electoral endorsements are featured. The primary source of the journal remains, as established at its founding, research scientists; editing standards are primarily concerned with technical readability. Each issue also features articles that are of general interest to the scientific community, namely business, funding, scientific ethics, and research breakthroughs. There are also sections on books, arts, and short science fiction stories.\\nThe main research published in Nature consists mostly of papers (articles or letters) in lightly edited form. They are highly technical and dense, but, due to imposed text limits, they are typically summaries of larger work. Innovations or breakthroughs in any scientific or technological field are featured in the journal as either letters or news articles. The papers that have been published in this journal are internationally acclaimed for maintaining high research standards. Conversely, due to the journal's exposure, it has at various times been a subject of controversy for its handling of academic dishonesty, the scientific method , and news coverage. Fewer than 8% of submitted papers are accepted for publication. [ 6 ] In 2007, Nature (together with Science ) received the Prince of Asturias Award for Communications and Humanity. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Nature mostly publishes research articles. Spotlight articles are not research papers but mostly news or magazine style papers and hence do not count towards impact factor nor receive similar recognition as research articles. Some spotlight articles are also paid by partners or sponsors.

June 16, 2025, 5:01 PM EDT By Evan Bush The scientific journal Nature wants to show people the nitty gritty of academic publishing. In a Monday editorial, the journal announced it would include peer review files with the papers it publishes, offering access to once behind-the-scenes processes in which reviewers critique scientific papers and authors respond with changes. Publishing peer review files at Nature has been optional since 2020; starting Monday, it is now automatic. “Our aim in doing so is to open up what many see as the ‘black box’ of science, shedding light on how a research paper is made. This serves to increase transparency and (we hope) to build trust in the scientific process,” the Nature editorial said. “Making peer-reviewer reports public also enriches science communication: it’s a chance to add to the ‘story’ of how a result is arrived at, or a conclusion supported.” Opening up the peer review process is growing more common among scientific journals, but Nature is one of the largest and most influential journals to adopt the practice. When a science study is submitted to a credible journal, the study will undergo a peer review, a process in which experts in the field probe the work for poor reasoning, bad research practices and data errors, among other issues. These outside experts share their feedback to journal editors and the authors in what are called referees’ reports. “Peer review improves papers,” the editorial said. “The exchanges between authors and referees should be seen as a crucial part of the scientific record, just as they are a key part of doing and disseminating research.” Nature’s new process will make the referees’ reports and authors’ responses public by default. The journal’s move comes at a time when trust in science has dipped. A Pew Research Center poll in fall 2024 showed that confidence in scientists had dropped about 10 percentage points from 2019 to 2024, and only 45% of Americans viewed scientists as good communicators. Michael Eisen, the former editor of the scientific journal eLife and a proponent of revamping the scientific publishing process, said he viewed Nature’s decision as “a move in the right direction overall toward more transparency in publishing.” “I think seeing the sausage is good,” Eisen said, adding that he thought it could help improve trust in science. “There’s a lot of criticism that stems from lack of understanding. That lack of understanding, from my point of view, stems from lack of transparency from scientists and science over what the process is.” Eisen said the move could help skeptics of science see how much rigor and questioning is applied to key topics. “With a vaccine paper, I think it would be good if people saw the scrutiny a paper goes through. It would help people understand and appreciate the science and how it’s contextualized better,” Eisen said. At the same time, it could help prevent the overstatement of splashy findings. “Maybe it will help people get past the idea that when a paper is published it’s bulletproof and there’s no questions remaining,” Eisen said. Eisen said Nature could also make public its reviewers’ comments on rejected manuscripts, which sometimes get published by other scientific journals. “The real radical move is publishing the reviews of all papers,” Eisen said. “Seeing what questions came up in the reviews of accepted papers is one thing; seeing why papers were rejected by journals is another.” Evan Bush Evan\"\n}\n"

Some of these objects are regarded as potentially hazardous objects if they are estimated to be large enough to cause regional devastation. This list also gives an overview of more detailed lists dedicated to specific years, such as List of asteroid close approaches to Earth in 2025 . Near-Earth object detection technology began to improve around 1998, so objects being detected as of 2004 could have been missed only a decade earlier due to a lack of dedicated near-Earth astronomical surveys . As sky surveys improve, smaller and smaller asteroids are regularly being discovered. As smaller asteroids are more numerous, ever more close approaches are detected within a given distance. In 2014, scientists estimated that several dozen asteroids in the 6–12 m (20–39 ft) size range fly by Earth at a distance closer than the Moon every year, but only a fraction of these are actually detected. [ 1 ] Definitions [ edit ] The lists below are based on the close approach database of the Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS), in its state as of 27 February 2025 [update] . [ 2 ] The database lists any approaches with a minimum distance less than 0.2 astronomical units (AU) from 1900 and until a century into the future which have been derived by orbit calculations. This includes some close approaches a full orbit or more before or after the object has been observed. The distance calculated for an approach has an uncertainty, the magnitude of which depends on the amount, length in time and quality of observations used, the extrapolation time from the observations, and perturbations by other objects along the predicted orbit. The uncertainty is usually characterised by the 3-sigma uncertainty region, which is the nominal close approach distance plus or minus three times the standard deviation , and includes 99.7% of the probability distribution. For predicted close approaches in the future, if Earth is near the uncertainty region or intersects it, an impact risk is calculated. [ 3 ] Confirmed impacts, however, aren't considered close approaches and are excluded from the CNEOS close approach database. Asteroids whose detection in space led to predicted impacts on Earth are listed separately, [ 4 ] as are the hundreds of other objects that collided with Earth's atmosphere which were not discovered in advance but were observed visually or recorded by sensors designed to detect detonation of nuclear devices. [ 5 ] The CNEOS list also does not include Earth-grazers , objects that enter Earth's atmosphere at a very shallow angle and leave it again without burning up completely, but they are listed separately below. Although Earth's atmosphere thins out continuously with distance from Earth's surface, the nominal limit of space is the Kármán line , which is 100 km (62 mi) above sea level. Timeline of closest approaches ever observed [ edit ] The list below shows all approaches by potentially hazardous objects (objects which can approach Earth within 0.05 AU) without atmospheric contact which have been the closest ever observed at some point in time, from the discovery of the first such object to the record holder, as of February 2025 [update] .

Timeline of known close approaches less than one lunar distance from Earth [ edit ] A list of the 46 known near-Earth asteroid close approaches less than 1 lunar distance (0.0025696 AU (384,410 km; 238,860 mi)) from Earth in 2025, as of 8 April 2025 [update] , based on the close approach database of the Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS). [ 1 ] For reference, the radius of Earth is about 0.0000426 AU (0.0166 LD; 6,370 km; 3,960 mi). Geosynchronous satellites have an orbit with semi-major axis length of 0.000282 AU (0.110 LD; 42,200 km; 26,200 mi). The closest approach of Earth by an asteroid in 2025 was that of 2025 BP 6 , an asteroid with a diameter of 1.1–2.6 m (3.6–8.5 ft), at about 9,710 km (6,030 mi; 6.49 × 10 −5 AU; 0.0253 LD) from the center of the Earth, or 3,300 km (2,100 mi) above its surface. [ 2 ] The largest asteroid to pass within 1 LD of Earth in 2025 was 2025 BB 2 at 20–44 m (66–144 ft) in diameter, for an absolute magnitude of 25.6. [ 3 ] The fastest asteroid to pass within 1 LD of Earth in 2025 was 2025 FX 2 that passed Earth with a velocity with respect to Earth of 25.08 km/s (56,100 mph), [ 4 ] while the slowest bypass within lunar distance was that of 2025 EW at a velocity with respect to Earth of 3.39 km/s (7,600 mph). [ 5 ] The CNEOS database of close approaches lists some close approaches a full orbit or more before the discovery of the object, derived by orbit calculation. The list below only includes close approaches that are evidenced by observations, thus the pre-discovery close approaches would only be included if the object was found by precovery , but there was no such close approach in 2025. This list and the relevant databases do not consider impacts as close approaches, thus this list does not include any of the objects that collided with Earth's atmosphere in 2025 , none of which were discovered in advance , but were observed visually or recorded by infrasound sensors designed to detect detonation of nuclear devices .

[ 8 ] In later years, the survey effort was expanded [ 9 ] to include smaller objects [ 10 ] which have the potential for large-scale, though not global, damage. NEOs have low surface gravity, and many have Earth-like orbits that make them easy targets for spacecraft. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] As of December 2024 [update] , five near-Earth comets [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] and six near-Earth asteroids, [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] one of them with a moon, [ 20 ] have been visited by spacecraft. Samples of three have been returned to Earth, [ 21 ] [ 22 ] and one successful deflection test was conducted. [ 23 ] Similar missions are in progress. Preliminary plans for commercial asteroid mining have been drafted by private startup companies, but few of these plans were pursued. [ 24 ] Definitions [ edit ] Plot of orbits of known potentially hazardous asteroids (size over 140 m (460 ft) and passing within 7.6 × 10 ^ 6 km (4.7 × 10 ^ 6 mi) of Earth's orbit) as of early 2013 ( alternate image ) Near-Earth objects (NEOs) are formally defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) as all small Solar System bodies with orbits around the Sun that are at least partially closer than 1.3 astronomical units (AU; Sun–Earth distance) from the Sun. [ 25 ] This definition excludes larger bodies such as planets , like Venus ; natural satellites which orbit bodies other than the Sun, like Earth's Moon ; and artificial bodies orbiting the Sun. A small Solar System body can be an asteroid or a comet , thus an NEO is either a near-Earth asteroid (NEA) or a near-Earth comet (NEC). The organisations cataloging NEOs further limit their definition of NEO to objects with an orbital period under 200 years, a restriction that applies to comets in particular, [ 2 ] [ 26 ] but this approach is not universal. [ 25 ] Some authors further restrict the definition to orbits that are at least partly further than 0.983 AU away from the Sun. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] NEOs are thus not necessarily currently near the Earth, but they can potentially approach the Earth relatively closely. Many NEOs have complex orbits due to constant perturbation by the Earth's gravity, and some of them can temporarily change from an orbit around the Sun to one around the Earth, but the term is applied flexibly for these objects, too. [ 29 ] The orbits of some NEOs intersect that of the Earth, so they pose a collision danger. [ 3 ] These are considered potentially hazardous objects (PHOs) if their estimated diameter is above 140 meters. PHOs include potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs). [ 30 ] [ 31 ] PHAs are defined based on two parameters relating to respectively their potential to approach the Earth dangerously closely and the estimated consequences that an impact would have if it occurs. [ 2 ] Objects with both an Earth minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID) of 0.05 AU or less and an absolute magnitude of 22.0 or brighter (a rough indicator of large size) are considered PHAs. Objects that either cannot approach closer to the Earth than 0.05 AU (7,500,000 km; 4,600,000 mi), or which are fainter than H = 22.0 (about 140 m (460 ft) in diameter with assumed albedo of 14%), are not considered PHAs.

It was claimed to have also been reported by Lebon and Dassier at Toulouse , and by Larivière at Artenac Observatory, during the early evening of March 21, 1846. [ 8 ] Petit proposed that this second moon had an elliptical orbit, a period of 2 hours 44 minutes, with 3,570 km (2,220 mi) apogee and 11.4 km (7.1 mi) perigee . [ 8 ] This claim was soon dismissed by his peers. [ 9 ] The 11.4 km (37,000 ft) perigee is similar to the cruising altitude of most modern airliners, and within Earth's atmosphere. Petit published another paper on his 1846 observations in 1861, basing the second moon's existence on perturbations in movements of the actual Moon. [ 8 ] This second moon hypothesis was not confirmed either. Petit's proposed moon became a plot point in Jules Verne 's 1870 science fiction novel Around the Moon . [ 10 ] Waltemath's moons [ edit ] In 1898, Hamburg scientist Dr. Georg Waltemath announced that he had located a system of tiny moons orbiting Earth. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] : 146 He had begun his search for secondary moons based on the hypothesis that something was gravitationally affecting the Moon's orbit. [ 13 ] Waltemath described one of the proposed moons as being 1,030,000 km (640,000 mi) from Earth, with a diameter of 700 km (430 mi), a 119-day orbital period , and a 177-day synodic period . [ 8 ] He also said it did not reflect enough sunlight to be observed without a telescope, unless viewed at certain times, and made several predictions of its next appearances. [ 13 ] \\\"Sometimes, it shines at night like the sun but only for an hour or so.\\\" [ 13 ] [ 12 ] : 148 E. Stone Wiggins , a Canadian weather expert, ascribed the cold spring of 1907 to the effect of a second moon, which he said he had first seen in 1882 and had publicized the find in 1884 in the New-York Tribune when he put it forward as probable cause of an anomalous solar eclipse of May of that year. [ 14 ] He said it was also probably the \\\"green crescent moon\\\" seen in New Zealand and later in North America in 1886, for periods of less than a half-hour each time. He said this was the \\\"second moon\\\" seen by  Waltemath in 1898. Wiggins hypothesized that the second moon had a high carbon atmosphere but could be seen occasionally by its reflected light. [ 15 ] The existence of these objects put forward by Waltemath (and Wiggins) was discredited after the absence of corroborating observation by other members of the scientific community . Especially problematic was a failed prediction that they would be seen in February 1898. [ 8 ] The August 1898 issue of Science mentioned that Waltemath had sent the journal \\\"an announcement of a third moon\\\", which he termed a wahrhafter Wetter- und Magnet-Mond (\\\"real weather and magnet moon\\\"). [ 16 ] It was supposedly 746 km (464 mi) in diameter, and at a distance of 427,250 km (265,480 mi) from Earth, closer than the \\\"second moon\\\" that he had seen previously. [ 17 ] Other claims [ edit ] In 1918, astrologer Walter Gorn Old, also known as Sepharial , claimed to have confirmed the existence of Waltemath's moon. He named it Lilith . Sepharial claimed that Lilith was a \\\"dark\\\" moon invisible for most of the time, but he claimed to be the first person in history to view it as it crossed the Sun. [ 18 ] In 1926, the science journal Die Sterne published the findings of amateur German astronomer W. Spill, who claimed to have successfully viewed a second moon orbiting Earth. [ 12 ] : 148 In the late 1960s, John Bagby claimed to have observed over ten small natural satellites of Earth, but this was not confirmed. [ 8 ] [ 19 ] General surveys [ edit ] William Henry Pickering (1858–1938) studied the possibility of a second moon and made a general search ruling out the possibility of many types of objects by 1903. His 1923 article, \\\"A Meteoric Satellite\\\", in Popular Astronomy [ 20 ] resulted in increased searches for small natural satellites by amateur astronomers. [ 8 ] [ 12 ] : 146 Pickering had also proposed the Moon itself had broken off from Earth.

The moon 's distance from Earth affects the strength of ocean tides and the appearance of solar eclipses in our skies. The average distance between the blue planet and its only natural satellite is about 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers), according to NASA . You may like Earth may have at least 6 'minimoons' at any given time. Where do they come from? What is the moon phase today? Lunar phases 2025 Why is the moon's far side so weird? China's lunar sample-return mission may have figured it out The moon does not orbit Earth in a perfect circle, so there are places along its trip when it is either closer or farther away from our planet than this average distance. Shortest distance between the moon and Earth: Perigee When the moon reaches its shortest distance to Earth — known as perigee — it is about 226,000 miles (363,300 km) away. If perigee coincides with a full moon phase, this is generally called a supermoon . The term is not a scientific one, but it is used by the skywatching community when the full moon appears within 90% of perigee. Supermoons appear roughly 17% bigger and 30% brighter than the faintest moon of the year. Since the moon's gravity exerts a pulling force on Earth's oceans to produce tides, the moon's closer proximity to Earth around perigee can also trigger higher-than-usual tides.

Greatest distance between the moon and Earth: Apogee When the moon is at its farthest distance from Earth, known as apogee, it is about 251,000 miles (405,500 km) from our planet. One of the clearest natural visuals for apogee are annular, or \\\"ring of fire,\\\" solar eclipses . A remarkable quality of solar eclipses is the serendipity of their existence. For the next 600 million years , the moon's proximity to Earth will be about 400 times greater than the sun's distance to Earth. Since the star's diameter is also approximately 400 times greater than that of the moon, the disks of both objects tend to match almost perfectly during solar eclipses. This produces moments of totality when just the solar corona peeks out from behind the moon. Related: Solar eclipses 2023: When, where & how to see them A partial solar eclipse is seen from Arlington, Virginia, Thursday, June 10, 2021. (Image credit: NASA/Bill Ingalls) But if the new moon phase that produces solar eclipses coincides with apogee, the moon's longer distance from Earth means that the lunar disk will appear much smaller in the sky. While still spectacular, annular solar eclipses do not completely block out the sun, Instead, they leave a ring of the solar disk visible to spectators. How long does it take to get to the moon? A range of factors determines how long it takes to reach the moon. Human missions, for instance, tend to take longer than passenger-free satellites. Whether or not an object stops at the moon or just zips by also comes into play. The USSR launched the first mission to the moon, Luna 1 , in 1959. With no propulsion system, the sphere-shaped satellite was hurled into space and took only 34 flight hours to make the trip. After its flyby, the satellite went into orbit around the sun, between the orbits of Earth and Mars . This remains one of the fastest trips to the moon. In 2003, the European Space Agency launched SMART-1, the first successful European spacecraft to the moon. Rather than travel a direct path, SMART-1 spiraled around Earth to reach its satellite, arriving more than a year after launch. Instead of propellant, SMART-1 made the first use of an ion\"\n}\n**Web Page 9:**\n{\n  \"id\": 9,\n  \"title\": \"Orbit of the Moon - Wikipedia\",\n  \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"On average, the distance to the Moon is about 384,400 km (238,900 mi) from Earth's centre, which corresponds to about 60 Earth radii or 1.28 light-seconds.\",\n  \"context\": \"Orbit of the Moon - Wikipedia Jump to content Main menu Main menu move to sidebar hide Navigation Main page Contents Current events Random article About Wikipedia Contact us Contribute Help Learn to edit Community portal Recent changes Upload file Special pages Search Search Appearance Donate Create account Log in Personal tools Donate Create account Log in Pages for logged out editors learn more Contributions Talk Contents move to sidebar hide (Top) 1 Properties Toggle Properties subsection 1.1 Elliptic shape 1.2 Elongation 1.3 Precession 1.4 Inclination 1.4.1 Nodes 1.4.2 Inclination to the equator and lunar standstill 1.4.3 Scale model 2 History of observations and measurements 3 Lunar periods 4 Tidal evolution 5 Libration 6 Path of Earth and Moon around Sun 7 See also 8 Notes 9 References 10 External links Toggle the table of contents Orbit of the Moon 31 languages Ænglisc العربية Беларуская Català Deutsch Ελληνικά Español Euskara فارسی Français 한국어 Հայերեն Bahasa Indonesia Italiano ქართული Македонски Bahasa Melayu 日本語 پنجابی Polski Português Română Русский Simple English Slovenščina Svenska Türkçe Українська اردو Tiếng Việt 中文 Edit links Article Talk English Read Edit View history Tools Tools move to sidebar hide Actions Read Edit View history General What links here Related changes Upload file Permanent link Page information Cite this page Get shortened URL Download QR code Print/export Download as PDF Printable version In other projects Wikimedia Commons Wikidata item Appearance move to sidebar hide From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia The Moon's circuit around Earth For the orbit of an object around the Moon, see Lunar orbit .

On average, the distance to the Moon is about 384,400 km (238,900 mi) from Earth's centre, which corresponds to about 60 Earth radii or 1.28 light-seconds. Earth and the Moon orbit about their barycentre (common centre of mass ), which lies about 4,670 km (2,900 miles) from Earth's centre (about 73% of its radius), forming a satellite system called the Earth–Moon system . With a mean orbital speed around the barycentre of 1.022 km/s (2,290 mph), the Moon covers a distance of approximately its diameter, or about half a degree on the celestial sphere , each hour. [ 6 ] The Moon differs from most regular satellites of other planets in that its orbital plane is closer to the ecliptic plane instead of its primary 's (in this case, Earth's) equatorial plane. The Moon's orbital plane is inclined by about 5.1° with respect to the ecliptic plane, whereas Earth's equatorial plane is tilted by about 23.4° with respect to the ecliptic plane.

The Moon's orbit around Earth has many variations ( perturbations ) due to the gravitational attraction of the Sun and planets, the study of which ( lunar theory ) has a long history. [ 7 ] Moon's orbit and sizes of Earth and Moon to scale. Comparison of the Moon's apparent size at lunar perigee – apogee . Elliptic shape [ edit ] The orbit of the Moon is a nearly circular ellipse about Earth (the semimajor and semiminor axes are 384,400 km and 383,800 km, respectively: a difference of only 0.16%). The equation of the ellipse yields an eccentricity of 0.0549 and perigee and apogee distances of 363,300 km (225744 mi) and 405,507 km (251970 mi) respectively (a difference of 11.6%). [ citation needed ] Since nearer objects appear larger, the Moon's apparent size changes as it moves toward and away from an observer on Earth. An event called a \\\" supermoon \\\" occurs when the full Moon is closest to Earth (perigee). The largest possible apparent diameter of the Moon is some 12% larger than the smallest (cf perigee versus apogee distances); the apparent area is then 25% greater and so is the amount of light it reflects toward Earth. The variance in the Moon's orbital distance corresponds with changes in its tangential and angular speeds, per Kepler's second law . The mean angular movement relative to an imaginary observer at the Earth–Moon barycentre is 13.176 ° per day to the east ( J2000.0 epoch).

Elongation [ edit ] The Moon's elongation is its angular distance east of the Sun at any time. At new moon, it is zero and the Moon is said to be in conjunction .

With her roots in Argentine folk music , Sosa became one of the preeminent exponents of El nuevo cancionero . She gave voice to songs written by many Latin American songwriters. Her music made people hail her as the \\\"voice of the voiceless ones\\\". [ 2 ] She was often called \\\"the conscience of Latin America\\\".

A rich, expressive vocalist and a gifted interpreter, Sosa was dubbed \\\"the voice of the silent majority\\\" for her choice of overtly political material, and alongside artists including Violeta Parra and Atahualpa Yupanqui, she spearheaded the rise of the so-called \\\"nueva canción\\\" movement, which heralded the emergence of protest music across Argentina and Chile during the '60s. The movement was crippled in 1973 by the CIA-sponsored coup which ousted democratically elected Chilean President Salvador Allende; with her repertoire of songs championing human rights and democracy, Sosa was viewed as a serious threat by the military regime which assumed power, and in 1975 she was arrested during a live performance which also resulted in the incarceration of many audience members. Death threats forced her to leave Argentina in 1979, and she remained in exile for three years, finally returning with a triumphant comeback performance in February 1982. Sosa recorded prolifically in the years to follow. In fall 2000, Sosa won a Grammy for Best Folk Album for Misa Criolla at the first annual Latin Grammy Awards, and again in 2003 and 2006 for Acústico and Corazón Libre, respectively. On October 4, 2009, after receiving multiple Grammy nominations for the album, Cantora, Mercedes Sosa passed away after a long battle with kidney disease. President Kilcher ordered three days of national mourning in her beloved Buenos Aires, culminating in a public funeral procession from the National Congress building to La Chacarita cemetery. ©  Jason Ankeny /TiVo Read more Read less Listen Share Copy the following link to share it Copy Similar artists Mother Tongue Cristina Del Valle Leon Gieco Violeta Parra Silvio Rodriguez Daniel Toro Argentino Luna Atahualpa Yupanqui Jorge Cafrune José Larralde Los Chalchaleros Los Carabajal The Sabres Of Paradise Teresa Parodi Pablo Milanes The Future Sound Of London Peteco Carabajal Victor Heredia Piero Rossy Facundo Cabral Moonwater Rapoon Hernan Figueroa Reyes GARCIA Charly Los Tucu Tucu Jacqueline Fuentes Melt Alfredo zitarrosa Pedro Aznar Horacio Guarany Pan Sonic Discography Sort and filter releases 0 77 album(s)\\n                                                                                       • Sorted by Bestseller Folk 9 Aug 2024 En Vivo en el Gran Rex 2006 (En Vivo) Mercedes Sosa Folk - Released by Inamu Discos on 9 Aug 2024 Available in 24-Bit/48 kHz Stereo Starting at 16.66€ Latin America 17 Nov 2024 Mercedes Sosa en New York, 1974 Mercedes Sosa Latin America - Released by Sony Music Argentina on 17 Nov 2024 Available in 24-Bit/44.1 kHz Stereo Starting at 11.69€ Latin America 8 Jul 2023 Me\"\n}\n**Web Page 10:**\n{\n  \"id\": 10,\n  \"title\": \"Artist Profiles: Mercedes Sosa | World Music Central\",\n  \"url\": \"https://worldmusiccentral.org/2017/03/19/artist-profiles-mercedes-sosa/\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Furthermore, he delved into the record business, producing world music studio albums and compilations.

She was honored throughout the world as “The Voice of Latin America” and revered in her native Argentina as “a symbol of life and freedom,” Mercedes Sosa was a dynamic, inspiring figure, and one of the most versatile artists on the world music scene. Sosa was also widely known for her message of peace, international integration, defense of human rights and artistic and personal integrity. After humble beginnings growing up in San Miguel de Tucuman, Mercedes Sosa spearheaded a traditional music and dance movement with her husband called Nuevo Cancionero which declared the materialization of protest music across Argentina and Chile. She served as a political figure of sorts by speaking out for the poor Argentines against military dictatorship and oppressive conditions. In 1966, Sosa recorded Yo no canto por cantar, beginning a 33-year career with PolyGram Records while continuing to record political music banned from radio broadcasts. Viewed as a serious threat to Argentina’s military regime, Sosa was searched and arrested on stage at a concert in La Plata in 1979. After receiving a series of death threats she was forced into exile seeking refuge in Paris and Madrid, Spain, where she finally settled, but persisted touring the United States, Europe and Brazil. Sosa made a triumphant return to Argentina in 1982, several months before the military regime collapsed as a result of the Malvines (Falklands) War, and gave a series of concerts at the Opera Theater in Buenos Aires. A live double album made up from these performances became an instant best seller. In 2005, she released Corazón Libre , produced by renowned musician, vocalist, and arranger “Chango” Farias Gómez with Jorge Giuliano (her long-time accompanist) contributing his talents along with leading folk guitarists Luis Salinas, Eduardo Falú, and Alberto Rojo. Using only simple acoustic guitar arrangements to accompany her legendary vocal style, Sosa went back to her roots and captured the spirit and soul of her homeland. The album contains folk-repertoire classics like “Zamba de Argamonte” and “Tonada del viejo amor,” but focused mainly on contemporary songs by Argentine poets and songwriters, whose lyrical and melancholy verses express a great connection with nature. “Todo Cambia” (Everything Changes), a new version of one of her biggest hits, is a very brave and meaningful song that has turned into a Latin American hymn as voiced by Sosa. The songs also told of the “suffering earth,” the “forgotten street children,” “lost love,” and the escape into music: “ Sometimes I sing ‘Milongas’ when it seems like life won’t go on .” The cover art for the album continued the simplistic theme of the album. It was drawn by friend and fan Joan Baez who gave it to Mercedes Sosa as a gift in 1988. Through the years she continued to impress fans and critics alike. Mercedes Sosa also won two Latin Grammy Awards in the Best Folk Album category: Misa Criolla (2000) and Acústico (2003). Mercedes Sosa died October 4, 2009, in Buenos Aires of liver disease. She was 74.

Its popularity as a pet has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive when released into nonnative environments. This report investigates the nonnative sightings of *Amphiprion ocellaris* in the United States before 2020, as documented by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The findings are presented in the form of five-digit zip codes, as requested.\\n\\n## Methodology\\n\\nThe research process involved analyzing data from the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database and other credible sources. The focus was on identifying specific locations where *Amphiprion ocellaris* was reported as a nonnative species before 2020. The data was cross-referenced with geographic identifiers to extract zip codes. Additionally, the reliability and relevance of the sources were evaluated to ensure the accuracy of the findings.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Findings\\n\\n### 1. **Nonnative Sightings of Amphiprion ocellaris**\\n\\nThe USGS NAS database documented a single confirmed nonnative sighting of *Amphiprion ocellaris* in the United States before 2020. This sighting occurred in **Fred Howard Park**, located in Pinellas County, Florida, in July 2018. The specimen was removed and transferred to the Clearwater Marine Aquarium, and the population was declared eradicated ([clown anemonefish (Amphiprion ocellaris) - Species Profile](<url-1>); [Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database](<url-2>)).\\n\\n#### Geographic Details:\\n- **Location:** Fred Howard Park, Pinellas County, Florida\\n- **Zip Code:** 34689 ([Fred Howard Park in Tarpon Springs](<url-9>))\\n\\nThis is the only documented nonnative occurrence of *Amphiprion ocellaris* in the USGS database before 2020.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. **Ecological Context and Introduction Pathway**\\n\\n#### Ecological Impact:\\nThe ecological impact of *Amphiprion ocellaris* as a nonnative species remains unknown due to the limited number of sightings and lack of long-term studies. The species is known for its symbiotic relationship with sea anemones, which provides it with protection from predators. However, the introduction of *Amphiprion ocellaris* into nonnative environments could potentially disrupt local ecosystems, particularly if it establishes a population ([clown anemonefish (Amphiprion ocellaris)](<url-3>)).\\n\\n#### Means of Introduction:\\nThe primary pathway for the introduction of *Amphiprion ocellaris* into nonnative environments is through aquarium releases. The popularity of the species in the pet trade, driven by its association with *Finding Nemo*, has led to concerns about irresponsible pet ownership and the release of unwanted fish into the wild ([Real clownfish suffered after 'Finding Nemo,' so 'Finding Dory' raises concerns](<url-5>)).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. **Analysis of Data Sources**\\n\\n#### Reliability of USGS Data:\\nThe USGS NAS database is a credible and authoritative source for tracking nonnative species in the United States. The data is peer-reviewed and regularly updated, ensuring high reliability. However, the database does not explicitly list zip codes for nonnative occurrences, requiring additional geographic interpretation ([Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database](<url-2>)).\\n\\n#### Limitations:\\n- The USGS database documented only one nonnative sighting of *Amphiprion ocellaris* before 2020, suggesting limited spread or reporting of the species.\\n- The absence of studies on the ecological impact of *Amphiprion ocellaris* in nonnative environments highlights a gap in research.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. **Summary Table of Findings**\\n\\n| **Location**         | **State** | **County**       | **Year** | **Zip Code** | **Status**   |\\n|-----------------------|-----------|------------------|----------|--------------|--------------|\\n| Fred Howard Park      | Florida   | Pinellas County  | 2018     | 34689        | Eradicated   |\\n\\n*Note: The data represents the only documented nonnative sighting of *Amphiprion ocellaris* in the United States before 2020.*\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe research confirms that *Amphiprion ocellaris* was found as a nonnative species in the United States before 2020 at Fred Howard Park in Pinellas County, Florida. The corresponding zip code for this location is **34689**. The species was introduced through aquarium releases and subsequently removed, with the population declared eradicated.\\n\\n### Key Insights:\\n1. **Limited Spread:** The USGS database documented only one nonnative sighting of *Amphiprion ocellaris* in the United States before 2020.\\n2. **Introduction Pathway:** The species was likely introduced through the release of aquarium pets, highlighting the need for responsible pet ownership.\\n3. **Research Gaps:** The ecological impact of *Amphiprion ocellaris* as a nonnative species remains unknown, necessitating further studies.\\n\\n### Recommendations:\\n- **Public Awareness:** Increase awareness about the ecological risks of releasing aquarium pets into the wild.\\n- **Monitoring and Research:** Conduct long-term studies to assess the potential ecological impact of *Amphiprion ocellaris* in nonnative environments.\\n- **Policy Implementation:** Strengthen regulations on the aquarium trade to prevent the release of nonnative species.\\n\\nBy addressing these recommendations, the risks associated with the introduction of *Amphiprion ocellaris* into nonnative environments can be mitigated.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- U.S. Geological Survey.

There’s a certain species of fish that was popularized as a pet by being the main character of the movie Finding Nemo. According to the USGS, where was this fish found as a nonnative species, before the year 2020? I need the answer formatted as the five-digit zip codes of the places the species was found, separated by commas if there is more than one place. false true true true true true # Report: Nonnative Sightings of Amphiprion ocellaris (Clownfish) in the United States Before 2020\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nThe clownfish (*Amphiprion ocellaris*), popularized by the movie *Finding Nemo*, has become a widely recognized species in the aquarium trade. Its popularity as a pet has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive when released into nonnative environments. This report investigates the nonnative sightings of *Amphiprion ocellaris* in the United States before 2020, as documented by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The findings are presented in the form of five-digit zip codes, as requested.\\n\\n## Methodology\\n\\nThe research process involved analyzing data from the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database and other credible sources. The focus was on identifying specific locations where *Amphiprion ocellaris* was reported as a nonnative species before 2020. The data was cross-referenced with geographic identifiers to extract zip codes. Additionally, the reliability and relevance of the sources were evaluated to ensure the accuracy of the findings.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Findings\\n\\n### 1. **Nonnative Sightings of Amphiprion ocellaris**\\n\\nThe USGS NAS database documented a single confirmed nonnative sighting of *Amphiprion ocellaris* in the United States before 2020. This sighting occurred in **Fred Howard Park**, located in Pinellas County, Florida, in July 2018. The specimen was removed and transferred to the Clearwater Marine Aquarium, and the population was declared eradicated ([clown anemonefish (Amphiprion ocellaris) - Species Profile](<url-1>); [Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database](<url-2>)).\\n\\n#### Geographic Details:\\n- **Location:** Fred Howard Park, Pinellas County, Florida\\n- **Zip Code:** 34689 ([Fred Howard Park in Tarpon Springs](<url-9>))\\n\\nThis is the only documented nonnative occurrence of *Amphiprion ocellaris* in the USGS database before 2020.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. **Ecological Context and Introduction Pathway**\\n\\n#### Ecological Impact:\\nThe ecological impact of *Amphiprion ocellaris* as a nonnative species remains unknown due to the limited number of sightings and lack of long-term studies. The species is known for its symbiotic relationship with sea anemones, which provides it with protection from predators. However, the introduction of *Amphiprion ocellaris* into nonnative environments could potentially disrupt local ecosystems, particularly if it establishes a population ([clown anemonefish (Amphiprion ocellaris)](<url-3>)).\\n\\n#### Means of Introduction:\\nThe primary pathway for the introduction of *Amphiprion ocellaris* into nonnative environments is through aquarium releases. The popularity of the species in the pet trade, driven by its association with *Finding Nemo*, has led to concerns about irresponsible pet ownership and the release of unwant\"\n}\n**Web Page 4:**\n{\n  \"id\": 4,\n  \"title\": \"clipping complex array crashes python · Issue #5354 - GitHub\",\n  \"url\": \"https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/5354\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"numpy#5354 Added testcase for clip-fft in the test_regression.py ... clipping complex array crashes python · Issue #5354 · numpy/numpy.\",\n  \"context\": \"clipping complex array crashes python · Issue #5354 · numpy/numpy · GitHub Skip to content Navigation Menu Toggle navigation Sign in Appearance settings Product GitHub Copilot Write better code with AI GitHub Spark New Build and deploy intelligent apps GitHub Models New Manage and compare prompts GitHub Advanced Security Find and fix vulnerabilities Actions Automate any workflow Codespaces Instant dev environments Issues Plan and track work Code Review Manage code changes Discussions Collaborate outside of code Code Search Find more, search less Explore Why GitHub All features Documentation GitHub Skills Blog Solutions By company size Enterprises Small and medium teams Startups Nonprofits By use case DevSecOps DevOps CI/CD View all use cases By industry Healthcare Financial services Manufacturing Government View all industries View all solutions Resources Topics AI DevOps Security Software Development View all Explore Learning Pathways Events & Webinars Ebooks & Whitepapers Customer Stories Partners Executive Insights Open Source GitHub Sponsors Fund open source developers The ReadME Project GitHub community articles Repositories Topics Trending Collections Enterprise Enterprise platform AI-powered developer platform Available add-ons GitHub Advanced Security Enterprise-grade security features Copilot for business Enterprise-grade AI features Premium Support Enterprise-grade 24/7 support Pricing Search or jump to...

I would bet that the polynomial goes crazy as soon as you move slightly outside of the area where you have known values. – Nick ODell Commented Jun 13, 2023 at 21:15 @NickODell it is true that the polynomial will go crazy. however i do want to know about this error message i am getting in general and also i would like to do a comparison of accuracy for different orders of polynomial fitting. – MRR Commented Jun 15, 2023 at 15:39 Add a comment | 2 Answers 2 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Trending (recent votes count more) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) 2 Extrapolation is inaccurate, but you can do it using scipy.interpolate.interp1d by telling it not to give bounds errors ( bounds_error=False ) and to fill the values via extrapolation ( fill_value=\\\"extrapolation\\\" ).

This issue was opened on **December 8, 2014**, and closed. While the label \"Regression\" is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, the issue references a test case added to `test_regression.py`, which strongly implies it is related to regression testing. The next relevant issue, **#9533** (opened August 8, 2017), does not mention the \"Regression\" label in its context. Thus, Issue #5354 is the oldest candidate based on available data. **Key Details from Web Page 4 (Issue #5354):**- **Title:** \"clipping complex array crashes python\"- **Opened Date:** December 8, 2014- **Context:** Mentions adding a test case to `test_regression.py`, suggesting a regression-related fix.- **Status:** Closed (exact close date not specified in snippet).

In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.\n\nA device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.\n\nThe ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.\n\nWhich ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize?

The first three balls (1, 2, 3) are on the platform.\n\n2. **Game Mechanics**: The pistons can eject a ball in one of three positions:\n   - If the first ball is ejected, the second and third balls advance one position, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position.\n   - If the second ball is ejected, the first ball is released, the third ball advances to the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to the second and third positions.\n   - If the third ball is ejected, the first ball is released, the second ball advances to the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to the second and third positions.\n\n3. **Objective**: We need to maximize the chance of our chosen ball being ejected by one of the pistons.\n\nLet's consider the probabilities for each ball being ejected:\n\n- **Ball 1**: It can only be ejected if the first piston fires. The probability of this happening is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n- **Ball 2**: It can be ejected in two ways:\n  - The second piston fires, ejecting the second ball. The probability of this happening is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n  - The first piston fires, and the third ball is ejected, causing the second ball to advance to the first position and the next ball to advance to the third position. The probability of this happening is \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{9}\\).\n\n  Therefore, the total probability for the second ball being ejected is \\(\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{3}{9} + \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{4}{9}\\).\n\n- **Ball 3**: It can be ejected in two ways:\n  - The third piston fires, ejecting the third ball. The probability of this happening is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n  - The first piston fires, and the second ball is ejected, causing the third ball to advance to the first position and the next ball to advance to the second position. The probability of this happening is \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{9}\\).\n\n  Therefore, the total probability for the third ball being ejected is \\(\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{3}{9} + \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{4}{9}\\).\n\n4. **Comparison**: \n   - Ball 1: \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)\n   - Ball 2: \\(\\frac{4}{9}\\)\n   - Ball 3: \\(\\frac{4}{9}\\)\n\nSince \\(\\frac{4}{9}\\) is greater than \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\), the best choice is either Ball 2 or Ball 3.\n\nTo maximize the odds, we should choose one of these balls. Since the probabilities for Ball 2 and Ball 3 are the same, we can choose either one.\n\nThus, the best choice is \\(\\boxed{2}\\) or \\(\\boxed{3}\\)."

This amended issue supersedes the first issue, which has been in effect since November 30, 1959. Voluntary U.S. grade standards are issued under the authority of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, which provides for the development of official U.S. grades to designate different levels of quality. These grade standards are available for use by producers, suppliers, buyers, and consumers. As in the case of other standards for grades of processed fruits and vegetables, these standards are designed to facilitate orderly marketing by providing a convenient basis for buying and selling, for establishing quality control programs, and for determining loan values. The standards also serve as a basis for the inspection and grading of commodities by the Federal inspection service, the only activity authorized to approve the designation of U.S. grades as referenced in the standards, as provided under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946. This service, available as on-line (in-plant) or lot inspection and grading of all processed fruit and vegetable products, is offered to interested parties, upon application, on a fee-for-service basis. The verification of some specific recommendations, requirements, or tolerances contained in the standards can be accomplished only by the use of on-line inspection procedures. In all instances, a grade can be assigned based on final product factors or characteristics. In addition to the U.S. grade standards, grading manuals or instructions for inspection of several processed fruits and vegetables are available upon request for a nominal fee. These manuals or instructions contain detailed interpretations of the grade standards and provide step-by-step procedures for grading the product. Grade standards are issued by the Department after careful consideration of all data and views submitted, and the Department welcomes suggestions which might aid in improving the standards in future revisions.

This achievement marks an important milestone in our journey toward building more capable and practical AI systems. GAIA players Humans achieve about 92% accuracy on the GAIA questions, some being quite challenging.  AI labs have submitted to the GAIA benchmark, including with Magentic-1 by Microsoft, Langfun Agent by Google, Hugging Face Agents, and many others related to research on agents by Princeton et al. GPT-4 with relevant tools achieves about 15%, Hugging Face Agent achieves 33%, Microsoft Research achieves 38% using the OpenAI o1 model or 32% with GPT-4o, while Tianqiao & Chrissy Chen Institute using o1-preview with omne achieves 41%.  Lately, Google’s Langfun Agent achieved 49%. Enterprise h2oGPTe Agent achieves 65%, a substantial leap. Understanding GAIA: Benchmark for Real-World AI Capability GAIA was created by Meta-FAIR, Meta-GenAI, HuggingFace, and AutoGPT teams to stress the limits of LLMs, which at the time (about a year ago) the co-author Yann LeCun noted that “current auto-regressive LLMs don't do very well.”  The GAIA benchmark stands apart from other AI benchmarks by focusing on real-world tasks that require a combination of reasoning, multi-modality handling, and tool use proficiency. Unlike narrower benchmarks such as the ARC Prize ( https://arcprize.org/arc , which focuses primarily on abstract visual pattern recognition), GAIA evaluates AI on their ability to handle practical tasks that businesses actually need. The benchmark includes 466 carefully crafted questions across three difficulty levels, testing: Web browsing and information synthesis Multi-modal understanding (text, images, audio) Code execution and data analysis File handling across various formats Complex reasoning and planning GAIA evaluates how well AI systems help users accomplish real tasks - from data analysis to document processing to complex research questions.  These questions tend to be more challenging than can be answered by standard “code interpreter” tools by OpenAI and others. Example questions: Level 1: What was the actual enrollment count of the clinical trial on H. pylori in acne vulgaris patients from Jan-May 2018 as listed on the NIH website? Level 2: According to https://www.bls.gov/cps/ , what was the difference in unemployment (in %) in the US in june 2009 between 20 years and over men and 20 years and over women? Level 3: In July 2, 1959 United States standards for grades of processed fruits, vegetables, and certain other products listed as dehydrated, consider the items in the 'dried and dehydrated section' specifically marked as dehydrated along with any items in the Frozen/Chilled section that contain the whole name of the item, but not if they're marked Chilled. As of August 2023, what is the percentage (to the nearest percent) of those standards that have been superseded by a new version since the date given in the 1959 standards? Answering level 1 questions requires about 5 steps for a human and up to 1 tool, but can challenge AI visual acuity.  Level 2 questions require 5-10 human steps and any tools, while level 3 questions require humans up to 50 steps and any number of tools. Why GAIA Matters for Business The business implications of GAIA performance are substantial.

During my testing, I noticed its ability to dynamically adjust search strategies, like backtracking when encountering contradictory sources. The interface is minimalist, almost austere, prioritizing function over flair. Perplexity Deep Research , in contrast, operates like a Swiss Army knife. Leveraging Amazon SageMaker HyperPod and fine-tuned open-source models (LLAMA 2 derivatives), it delivers answers in under three minutes — often before I’ve finished my coffee. The platform’s integration with AWS infrastructure is evident in its speed; during peak hours, it handled 100,000+ queries per hour without breaking a sweat. Key Takeaway: ChatGPT = Depth-first exploration Perplexity = Breadth-first efficiency The Benchmark Battleground Before diving into my real-world tests, let’s contextualize their technical capabilities using third-party metrics: These numbers set the stage for my hands-on experiments. Test 1: Market Research for an iOS Translation App Task: “ Help me find iOS and android adoption rates, % who want to learn another language, and change in mobile penetration, over the past 10 years, for top 10 developed and top 10 developing countries by GDP. Lay this info out in a table and separate stats into columns, and include recommendations on markets to target for a new iOS translation app from ChatGPT, focusing on markets ChatGPT is currently active in. .” ChatGPT’s Approach: First Output: A verbose 1,200-word analysis with key stats buried in paragraphs. After Refinement: A structured table separating developed vs. developing economies, citing StatCounter and Eurobarometer surveys. Strength: Nuanced recommendations prioritizing iOS-heavy markets (Japan, U.S.) while flagging geopolitical risks in China/Russia. Weakness: Required explicit prompting to format data (“Lay this info out in a table”). Perplexity’s Approach: First Output: A pre-formatted table with GSMA/StatCounter data, exportable as CSV. Recommendations: Similar tiered targeting but emphasized cost-effective entry into Latin America (Mexico’s 15M iPhone users). Strength: 24 cited sources, including hyperlinks to GSMA Intelligence reports. Weakness: Overlooked ChatGPT’s regional availability constraints in Brazil. My Verdict: 🏆 ChatGPT Deep Research Perplexity had the edge in data exportability , but ChatGPT offered a more insightful analysis and structured recommendations . Perplexity didn't get the queries at first time, I needed to ask it to create the answer in table format twice. Test 2: Regulatory Archaeology Task: “ On July 2, 1959, United States standards for grades of processed fruits, vegetables, and certain other products listed as dehydrated, consider the items in the “dried and dehydrated section” specifically marked as dehydrated along with any items in the Frozen/Chilled section that contain the whole name of the item, but not if they’re marked Chilled. As of August 2023, what is the percentage (to the nearest percent) of those standards that have been superseded by a new version since the date given in the 1959 standards? ” ChatGPT’s Struggle: Process: Wandered through USDA archives, misinterpreting 1970s amendments as “revisions” when some were merely clarifications. Output: A disjointed 43% estimate with vague references to “10 of 23 standards.” Pain Point: Hallucinated a non-existent 2016 broccoli standard update. Perplexity’s Precision: Process: Cross-referenced FDA dockets, USDA bulletins, and historical texts from the Biodiversity Heritage Library. Output: A 43% supersedure rate validated via: 4/11 frozen standards revised (e.g., peas in 1975) 3/7 dehydrated standards updated (e.g., peaches in 1974) Bonus: Linked directly to scanned 1959 Federal Register pages. My Verdict: Perplexity dominated here. Its ability to parse pre-2010 academic papers — a noted ChatGPT weakness — and auto-cite primary sources felt like having a legal researcher on standby. Test 3: Gene Therapy Deep Dive Task: “ How many gene therapies have gained regulatory approval in the United States for the treatment of hemophilia as of October 15th 2024. Include the name of the developer company, as well as the respective year of approval. Provide a comprehensive summary of the viral vector technology employed in each of these approved therapies, highlighting key features. ” ChatGPT’s Output: Correctly identified all three therapies (Hemgenix, Roctavian, Beqvez). Provided crisp vector summaries: AAV5 vs. AAVrh74 serotypes FIX-Padua vs. BDD-FVIII transgenes Missing: Detailed trial data, and exact approval date (e.g., Roctavian’s 92% bleeding reduction). Perplexity’s Output: Matched ChatGPT’s therapy list but added: Pricing (2.9M−2.9 M −3.5M per dose) Long-term safety data (15-year tumor risk monitoring) Standout: A comparative table of vector parameters (seroprevalence, manufacturing). My Verdict: Tie. Both delivered clinical accuracy, but Perplexity’s inclusion of cost/access analysis better served my investor-focused angle. Test 4: Linguistic Futurism Task: “Translate sentences into a 25th-century English creole with Hindi ergativity, SOV order, and Turkish-style reduplication.” ChatGPT’s Creativity: Nailed complex features: “Themen-ne thetruck-ko withhay loaded” (ergative -ne + SOV) “emearly” for “earlier” (vowel-initial reduplication) Resource Depth: Cited Hindi split ergativity papers and Turkish reduplication studies. Perplexity’s Failure: Timed out twice despite 15-minute allowances. Final Output: A garbled attempt conflating Swahili noun classes with Mandarin tones. My Verdict: ChatGPT’s clear win. It's training on linguistic corpora (UGLAS, Ethnologue) enabled rule-based syntheses I’d expect from a grad student.

Deep Dive Opinion Library Events Press Releases Topics Sign up Search Sign up Search Operations Procurement Labor Regulation Technology Sustainability Openings & Expansions An article from Dive Brief FDA to revoke dozens of food product standards The move targets regulations aimed at ensuring ingredients and production processes remain consistent with consumer expectations. Published July 18, 2025 Sarah Zimmerman Editor post share post print email license FDA headquarters in White Oak, Maryland Sarah Silbiger via Getty Images First published on Listen to the article 3 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback . Dive Brief: The FDA on Wednesday said it plans to eliminate standards for more than 50 food products, with the agency declaring the regulations “obsolete and unnecessary.” The move would revoke 52 standards of identity for products in the dairy, baked goods and canned fruit and vegetable segments, among other categories. The standards define a food’s ingredient composition or processing requirements to ensure that manufacturers cannot cut corners in production. The removal is the first step in an ongoing review of more than 250 standards of identity, the FDA said. The agency added that in some cases, the standards stifled innovation and prevented manufacturers from innovating or making their products healthier. Dive Insight: Beginning in 1939, the FDA started introducing standards for certain products in response to food manufacturers skimping on ingredients during the Great Depression, when companies would, for example, sell jams containing little actual fruit . Modern labeling requirements have largely replaced these standards of identity, with consumers now able to see nutrition standards, potential allergens and a list of ingredients on products. Still, the standards have, for the most part, remained in place to ensure characteristics, ingredients and production processes are consistent with consumer expectations. The dairy industry has for years pushed to remove identity standards, saying a product could be considered misbranded or adulterated if a manufacturer uses a new innovative process or ingredient that are not specifically included in law. Of the 280 standards of identity, one-third of them affect dairy products, according to the International Dairy Foods Association . The standards can be rigid, as the Penn State College of Agricultural Sciences points out . “Cheddar” cheese, for example, must have a maximum moisture content of 39% and a minimum of 50% fat in the remaining solids. “Monterey Jack” must use pasteurized milk, but “Colby” can use raw milk as long as it’s aged for 60 days at a certain temperature. More than a quarter of the product standards the FDA intends to revoke are in the cheese segment. Other standards set to be eliminated include those for canned fruit juices, macaroni and noodle products, plus vanilla extract and flavorings. While the FDA is proposing to revoke 41 standards, the agency issued a direct rule outright eliminating 11 standards for canned fruits and vegetables no longer sold in U.S. grocery stores. “Antiquated food standards are no longer serving to protect consumers,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said in a statement. “It is common sense to revoke them and move to a more judicious use of food standards and agency resources.” The FDA has previously revoked standards of identity , though never on this large of a scale. Last year, the agency eliminated the standard for frozen cherry pie, and in 2022 removed the standard for French Dressing.

The roles of each party are described below. The definitions should be non-proprietary as not to favor one ingredient producer over another. Materials to be used as feed ingredients should have the following attributes: They should be consistent batch to batch. The material should not be a combination of other ingredients. The intended use should not be to mitigate, treat, or diagnose a disease (other than a nutritional deficiency), but rather to provide nutrition, flavor, aroma for the animal or provide a technical effect in the feed. It is the manufacturer’s responsibility to produce a safe ingredient for its intended purpose. The Requester Prior to submitting a request for a new or modified definition, the requester (industry, public, regulatory official, etc.) should consider the current ingredient definitions and develop a draft definition that includes the intended use. The requester should then contact the appropriate investigator (see the AAFCO Official Publication or website for current listing) by email to definitions@aafco.org to discuss the draft definition. Following the initial discussion, a requester should then make a request to the investigator in writing that contains the information described below, if pertinent, so there is sufficient information for the decision process: (1) Firm and contact person. (2) Summary of the request, including name of the ingredient, intended use, and rationale for the request. A. The proposed name shall: I. Not contain commas. II. Begin with the base material and then list any needed qualifiers (Beet Pulp plain dried). III. Be in alignment with common or usual name conventions in 21 CFR 502.5(a). IV. Alternate names to be used on labeling shall be clearly stated at the end of the definition. “‘Plain Dried Beet Pulp’ shall be used on all labeling.” V. Not include a trade name or be proprietary in nature. (3) Proposed definition. (4) Description of the ingredient (e.g., source, physical characteristics, any marketed formulation(s)). (5) Proposed labeling (can be generic). (6) Historical regulation of the ingredient, if any. (7) Description of the manufacturing processes to support identity, composition, and consistent manufacturing of the ingredient. Data to include: A. A description of the manufacturing process, 2024 Official Publication346 Official Feed Terms, Common or Usual Ingredient Names and Ingredient Definitions B. A list and regulatory citation for all substances used in its preparation, C. Stability data (including packaging), D. Homogeneity data when ingredient is used at low inclusion rate, and E.

The spatial distribution of viruses was represented on an ArcGIS map. Of all screened samples, 24% (92/380) were infected with at least one virus. Sweetpotato feathery mottle virus (65/92), sweetpotato chlorotic fleck virus (17/92) and sweetpotato mild mottle virus (8/92) were the most frequent viruses detected. Of sampled fields, 74% (28/38) had at least one virus-infected sweetpotato plant. The four viruses detected are the major viruses causing significant yield losses in major sweetpotato growing regions of Uganda and East Africa. The findings of limited distribution and low prevalence of the viruses in the region indicate it causes less burden to sweetpotato production in the sub-region compared with other parts of Uganda. 1. Introduction Sweetpotato is an important crop for smallholder farmers in resource-limited rural settings of Africa. It requires few inputs to grow, yields relatively well in poor soils and is drought tolerant [ 1 ]. It is a good carbohydrate source and the cheapest food security crop for subsistence farmers in Africa [ 2 , 3 ]. In addition, sweetpotato tubers and leaves are regarded as the cheapest source of vitamins (A, riboflavin, thiamine and niacin), micro-nutrients (iron, zinc, calcium and magnesium), protein, fat and dietary fibre [ [3] , [4] , [5] ]. The importance of sweetpotato is constantly increasing but its production is greatly constrained by viruses, among other biotic factors. Up to seven sweetpotato viruses have been reported to infect and constrain sweetpotato production in East Africa. Six of these have been particularly reported in Uganda [ 6 , 7 ], where they can cause up to 98% yield losses [ 8 ]. Propagation of sweetpotato plants using vine cuttings remain the most important mechanisms for the spread, survival and transmission of sweetpotato viruses from generation to generation [ 9 ]. In addition, traditional agricultural practices such as piecemeal harvest allow the virus to be maintain for long within the infected plants such that it act as potential source of inoculum for future infection [ 1 ]. Sharing of sweet potato vines amongst farmers or buying vines from the market during time of shortages are some of the farming practices that promote the spread of sweetpotato viruses among different farms [ 10 ]. SPCSV is transmitted by whitefly common species known as Bemisia tabaci while SPFMV is transmitted by aphids ( Aphis gossypii ) [ 10 , 11 ]. Some of the viruses are transmitted through sap inoculation from infected plant by use of contaminated tools during vine cutting among the local farmers [ 12 ]. Most sweetpotato viruses do not produce severe symptoms as single infections but have devastating co-infection effects [ 9 ]. Synergistic interaction among sweetpotato feathery mottle virus (SPFMV), sweetpotato mild mottle virus (SPMMV) and sweetpotato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV) causes a very severe sweetpotato condition – sweetpotato chlorotic dwarf disease [ 10 ]. Co-infections involving SPFMV and SPCSV produce a severe disease syndrome known as sweetpotato virus disease (SPVD) that is associated with severe yield losses in a number of sweetpotato production systems [ 1 , 11 , 12 ]. Currently SPVD is widespread in the major sweetpotato growing region of Uganda [ 6 ] and has been implicated in elimination of some early maturing and high yielding cultivars [ 11 ]. In addition, high incidences of SPFMV and SPCSV have been reported in central Uganda [ 6 , 8 ]. However, reports on the incidence of these viruses and their effect on sweetpotato production in the former war-zone of northern Uganda are limited. Such information is essential in guiding control strategies toward managing spread of these diseases. This study was therefore carried out to determine the prevalence of different sweetpotato viruses in northern Uganda\"\n}\n**Web Page 2:**\n{\n  \"id\": 2,\n  \"title\": \"Genomic analysis of Sweet potato feathery mottle virus from East ...\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885576519303534\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Both SPFMV and Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV) have higher prevalence and distribution across East Africa than any of the sweet potato viruses ...\",\n  \"context\": \"HTTP error occurred: 400 Client Error: Bad Request for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/unsupported_browser\"\n}\n**Web Page 3:**\n{\n  \"id\": 3,\n  \"title\": \"Application of Grafting Method in Resistance Identification of Sweet ...\",\n  \"url\": \"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9964620/\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"SPFMV is a member of the genus Potyvirus in the Potyviridae family, while SPCSV belongs to the genus Crinivirus in the Closteroviridae family [1] ...\",\n  \"context\": \"ng 400715, China Investigation Find articles by Xuli Wu 1, 2 , Kai Zhang Kai Zhang 1 College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Southwest University, Beibei, Chongqing 400715, China 2 Key Laboratory of Biology and Genetic Breeding for Tuber and Root Crops in Chongqing, Beibei, Chongqing 400715, China 3 State Cultivation Base of Crop Stress Biology for Southern Mountainous Land of Southwest University, Beibei, Chongqing 400715, China Writing – review & editing Find articles by Kai Zhang 1, 2, 3, * , Jichun Wang Jichun Wang 1 College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Southwest University, Beibei, Chongqing 400715, China 2 Key Laboratory of Biology and Genetic Breeding for Tuber and Root Crops in Chongqing, Beibei, Chongqing 400715, China 3 State Cultivation Base of Crop Stress Biology for Southern Mountainous Land of Southwest University, Beibei, Chongqing 400715, China Supervision, Funding acquisition Find articles by Jichun Wang 1, 2, 3, * , Changwen Lv Changwen Lv 1 College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Southwest University, Beibei, Chongqing 400715, China 2 Key Laboratory of Biology and Genetic Breeding for Tuber and Root Crops in Chongqing, Beibei, Chongqing 400715, China 3 State Cultivation Base of Crop Stress Biology for Southern Mountainous Land of Southwest University, Beibei, Chongqing 400715, China Project administration, Funding acquisition Find articles by Changwen Lv 1, 2, 3, * Editor: Vittorio Rossi Author information Article notes Copyright and License information 1 College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Southwest University, Beibei, Chongqing 400715, China 2 Key Laboratory of Biology and Genetic Breeding for Tuber and Root Crops in Chongqing, Beibei, Chongqing 400715, China 3 State Cultivation Base of Crop Stress Biology for Southern Mountainous Land of Southwest University, Beibei, Chongqing 400715, China * Correspondence: kaizhang2013@gmail.com (K.Z.); wjchun@swu.edu.cn (J.W.); lvcgwn@163.com (C.L.); Tel.: +86-6825-1264 (K.Z. & J.W. & C.L.)

Lam] that seriously affects the yield of sweet potato. Therefore, the establishment of a simple, rapid and effective method to detect SPVD is of great significance for the early warning and prevention of this disease. In this study, the experiment was carried out in two years to compare the grafting method and side grafting method for three sweet potato varieties, and the optimal grafting method was selected. After grafting with seedlings infected with SPVD, the symptomatic diagnosis and serological detection were performed in 86 host varieties, and the differences in SPVD resistance were determined by fluorescence quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and nitrocellulose membrane enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (NCM-ELISA).

Only limited information is available on wild species able to host economically important viruses that infect sweetpotatoes ( Ipomoea batatas ). In this study, Sweet potato chlorotic fleck virus (SPCFV; Carlavirus , Betaflexiviridae) and Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV; Crinivirus , Closteroviridae) were surveyed in wild plants of family Convolvulaceae (genera Astripomoea , Ipomoea , Hewittia and Lepistemon ) in Uganda. Plants belonging to 26 wild species, including annuals, biannuals and perennials from four agro-ecological zones, were observed for virus-like symptoms in 2004 and 2007 and sampled for virus testing. SPCFV was detected in 84 (2.9%) of 2864 plants tested from 17 species. SPCSV was detected in 66 (5.4%) of the 1224 plants from 12 species sampled in 2007. Some SPCSV-infected plants were also infected with Sweet potato feathery mottle virus (SPFMV; Potyvirus , Potyviridae; 1.3%), Sweet potato mild mottle virus (SPMMV; Ipomovirus , Potyviridae; 0.5%) or both (0.4%), but none of these three viruses were detected in SPCFV-infected plants. Co-infection of SPFMV with SPMMV was detected in 1.2% of plants sampled. Virus-like symptoms were observed in 367 wild plants (12.8%), of which 42 plants (11.4%) were negative for the viruses tested. Almost all (92.4%) the 419 sweetpotato plants sampled from fields close to the tested wild plants displayed virus-like symptoms, and 87.1% were infected with one or more of the four viruses. Phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses of the 3′-proximal genomic region of SPCFV, including the silencing suppressor (NaBP)- and coat protein (CP)-coding regions implicated strong purifying selection on the CP and NaBP , and that the SPCFV strains from East Africa are distinguishable from those from other continents. However, the strains from wild species and sweetpotato were indistinguishable, suggesting reciprocal movement of SPCFV between wild and cultivated Convolvulaceae plants in the field.

Introduction There is evidence that wild flora acts as a reservoir of viruses causing significant losses in nearby crops and vice versa [ 1 – 7 ]. However, information about viruses in wild species is still quite limited. This may in part be due to the fact that viral infections in wild plants are often symptomless, even when the same infection may have obvious symptoms in cultivated plants [ 8 – 10 ]. Whether the same virus strains can infect wild and cultivated plants, but are better adapted to wild plants and hence cause no symptoms, is an issue requiring further study [ 11 , 12 ]. The geospatial distribution and genetic variability of viruses in wild species is also poorly understood [ 13 , 14 ]. Although some metagenomic surveys have explored virus diversity in wild plant communities [ 14 –\"\n}\n**Web Page 7:**\n{\n  \"id\": 7,\n  \"title\": \"EC Numbers for Virus Testing Enzymes | Shared Grok Conversation\",\n  \"url\": \"https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_d74c5864-a859-480d-b10b-7b600c16af9c\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"The evidence leans toward these enzymes being standard in the detection methods described in the 2016 paper about SPFMV and SPCSV in Uganda, known as the Pearl ...\",\n  \"context\": \"HTTP error occurred: 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_d74c5864-a859-480d-b10b-7b600c16af9c\"\n}\n**Web Page 8:**\n{\n  \"id\": 8,\n  \"title\": \"[PDF] Effects of Sweet Potato Feathery Mottle Virus and Sweet ... - CORE\",\n  \"url\": \"https://core.ac.uk/download/132682606.pdf\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Sweet potato feathery mottle virus (SPFMV) and Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV) are the most common viruses infecting sweetpotato in.

Recovery from SPFMV appeared to be more frequent at NaSARRI than at MUARIK. Infection by SPCSV alone resulted in yield losses of 14–52%, while mixed infections of SPFMV+SPCSV resulted in yield losses in both locations of 60–95% depending on the cultivar. SPCSV and mixed infections of SPFMV+SPCSV also reduced the number of roots formed as well as the diameter of the roots, resulting in a greater length to diameter ratio compared to the healthy control. This study, therefore, confirms that both SPFMV and SPCSV, both singly and when mixed, can reduce yield, the extent depending on the cultivar. To mitigate the effect of these viruses, farmers should useclean planting materialsof resistant varieties. curl Uganda virus (SPLCUV) (Gibson et al. 1998; Introduction Mukasa et al. 2003; Aritua et al. 2007; Wasswa et al.

Sweetpotato shows significant potential to contribute to reducing the Global Hunger Index, which reflects deficiencies in calories and micronutrients based on the components of hunger, undernourishment, under-five mortality rate, stunting and wasting. Its genetic diversity has been harnessed through breeding to increase vitamin A, iron, and zinc content, virus resistance and climate resilience for the world's food needs. Africa and India are the most food-insecure regions. The main objectives of this research were to: provide information and a knowledge base on sweetpotato breeding in Africa for biofortification of vitamin A, iron, and zinc, drought tolerance and virus resistance; recommend procedures for generating new breeding populations and varieties; and develop new tools, technologies and methods for sweetpotato improvement. The research was implemented between 2009 and 2020 in 14 collaborating African countries using introduced and local genotypes. The redesigned accelerated breeding scheme resulted in increased genetic gains for vitamin A, iron, zinc contents and virus resistance, and the release by sub-Saharan African countries of 158 varieties; 98 of them orange-fleshed; 55 varieties bred by an accelerated breeding scheme; 27 drought-tolerant and two with enhanced iron and zinc content. Our experience has demonstrated that through the use of more optimized, standardized and collaborative breeding procedures by breeding programs across Africa, it is possible to speed official sweetpotato variety release and contribute to reducing the severe micronutrient deficiencies on the continent. Introduction Sweetpotato [ Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.] is a resilient food crop with great potential to contribute to reducing hunger in the world. Hunger typically refers to the distress associated with insufficient caloric intake given a person's sex, age, stature, and physical activity level ( FAO, 2017 ). Undernutrition is a consequence of inadequate intake of nutritious food, poor utilization of nutrients due to infections or other illnesses, or a combination of these factors. This stems from a range of causes, including household food insecurity; inadequate maternal health or childcare practices; or insufficient access to health services, safe water, and sanitation. Sweetpotato, however, has many varieties that mature in 4–5 months, enabling it\"\n}\n**Web Page 10:**\n{\n  \"id\": 10,\n  \"title\": \"MikeMpapa/orm-v0-truncated-binary-distillbert - Hugging Face\",\n  \"url\": \"https://huggingface.co/datasets/MikeMpapa/orm-v0-truncated-binary-distillbert/viewer/default/train\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"... paper or related papers that might describe the virus testing methods used in uganda for spfmv and spcsv in 2016. code : ` ` ` python search _ query = \\\\\\\" spfmv ...\",\n  \"context\": \"[ state of washington list of cities towns county seats ] ( https : / / countymapsofwashington. com / aaallwa. shtml ) source : countymapsofwashington. com 7.

It began in 1906 during the Qajar dynasty and into the start of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1923 and into the 1979 Iranian Revolution before being abolished in 1989. History of the office [ edit ] Qajar era [ edit ] Main article: Qajar Iran In the Qajar era, prime ministers were known by different titles. The post itself was mainly known as ataabak or ataabak-e a'zam (grand ataabak ), or sometimes sadr-e a'zam (premier) at the beginning, but became ra'is ol-vozaraa (head of ministers) at the end. The title of nakhost vazir (prime minister) was rarely used. The prime minister was usually called by the honorific title hazrat-e ashraf . Reza Khan Sardar Sepah became the last prime minister of the Qajar dynasty in 1923. For a list of Iranian 'prime ministers' prior to 1907 see List of grand viziers of Persia . Pahlavi era [ edit ] Main article: Pahlavi Iran In 1925, Reza Shah became the Shah of Iran. He installed Mohammad Ali Foroughi as the prime minister. [ 1 ] In 1941 his son Mohammad Reza Pahlavi became Shah. He installed Mohammad-Ali Foroughi as the prime minister too. In 1951, Mohammad Mosaddegh became Prime Minister but was overthrown in a counter-coup d'état in 1953 . Amir-Abbas Hoveyda became Prime minister of Iran in 1965 and remained in office until 1977. Shapour Bakhtiar was the last Prime Minister of the Pahlavi era. Islamic Republic of Iran [ edit ] After the Iranian Revolution of 1979, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini installed Mehdi Bazargan as the Prime Minister of an interim government , which served until November 1979. The government resigned during the Iran hostage crisis , but mentioned that it has not been the sole reason, and the decision for mass resignation had been reached one day before the invasion of the United States embassy by the Iranian students. The post was left empty until Abolhassan Banisadr became president in January 1980 and chose Mohammad-Ali Rajai as his prime minister, mainly because of pressures imposed by Majlis representatives, especially those close to the Islamic Republican Party . Rajai served in the post until Banisadr's impeachment in June 1981, and was elected as president in the elections of July 24, 1981. Rajai chose Mohammad Javad Bahonar as his prime minister, but they were assassinated together in the Prime Minister's office only a few weeks later on August 30, 1981. When Ali Khamenei became president in the elections of October 1981, he first introduced right-leaning Ali Akbar Velayati to the Majlis as his prime minister, but he was voted down by the then left-leaning majority of the parliament, which then forced their preferred prime minister to Khamenei, namely Mir-Hossein Mousavi . The dispute finally ended following intervention by the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, who advised the president to accept Mousavi.

After taking political science degrees at the universities of Brussels and Paris, Hoveyda joined the Iranian Foreign Office and served in Paris (1945–47), Bonn (1947–51), Ankara (1957), and at the United Nations in New York City (1951–57). In 1958 he was appointed to the board of the National Iranian Oil Company. After becoming prime minister he organized the October 1971 festivities at Persepolis commemorating the 2,500th anniversary of the founding of the Persian Empire. As leader of the ruling Iran Novin (New Iran) Party he won a landslide victory at the 1971 general elections. Iran’s financial strength enabled Hoveyda to strike advantageous bargains with Western customers for Iranian oil in order to promote Iran’s own economic development. But the Shah’s gratitude proved limited and on Aug. 7, 1977, Hoveyda was replaced by Jamshid Amouzegar. In November 1978 Hoveyda was detained by the Shah’s short-lived military government . At the time of the February 1979 uprising he gave himself up to the new government appointed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini . Two months later he was sentenced to death by the Islāmic Revolutionary Court and shot the same day.

These groups, which included clergy, landowners, intellectuals , and merchants, had previously come together in the Constitutional Revolution of 1905–11. Efforts toward satisfactory reform were continually stifled, however, amid reemerging social tensions as well as foreign intervention from Russia , the United Kingdom , and, later, the United States . The United Kingdom helped Reza Shah Pahlavi establish a monarchy in 1921. Along with Russia, the U.K. then pushed Reza Shah into exile in 1941, and his son Mohammad Reza Pahlavi took the throne. In 1953, amid a power struggle between Mohammed Reza Shah and Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh , the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the U.K. Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) orchestrated a coup against Mosaddegh’s government.

Iran News Now Iran Culture & Society Who is who? Who was Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Shah, Iran’s Last Pahlavi Dictator? Written by Hossein Daei Alilslam 10th February 2023 Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Reddit Email Print Iran’s revolution has entered its fifth month. While Iranians have clearly demanded a true democracy by chanting, “Down with the oppressor, be it Shah or the mullahs,” some speak of the return of the deposed Pahlavi dictatorship in Iran. Although this is a historical impossibility, it is worth knowing who was Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Pahlavi dictator, and how his policies resulted in a series of uprisings and eventually the 1979 revolution. How he helped mullahs hijack the Iranian people’s revolution? Born in 1919 in Tehran, Mohammad Reza was the second king or Shah of Pahlavi’s dictatorship . The early years of Shah’s reign were the hotbed of democratic politics in Iran. His response was clear: absolute oppression and tying his regime’s destiny to foreign powers. To fortify his regime, Shah began lavishing his attention on the army, which he saw as his personal fiefdom. He gradually began to curtail the powers of parliament and clamped down on the press. He soon began clashing with dissidents, namely with Mohammad Mossadegh , an ardent Iranian nationalist, and member of the Majlis who spearheaded legislation in the Majlis calling for the nationalization of the Iranian oil industry, ending almost 50 years of British monopoly over Iran’s oil revenues. The Shah of Iran and SAVAK (1976) | 60 Minutes Archive Watch this video on YouTube In March 1951, Mosaddegh succeeded in passing his bill in parliament to nationalize the assets of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC), later known as British Petroleum (BP). William D’Arcy , a British businessman, had purchased the right to exploit Iran’s oilfields in 1901, paying the country’s ruling family £20,000 together with a promise of a 16% share of annual profits.  Iranians did not benefit from this agreement at all, and for them, Dr. Mosaddegh resembled hope. Seeing Mosaddegh’s popularity grow, the Shah was forced to appoint him as Prime Minister in April 1951. During his short tenure in office (April 1951-August 1953), he rejected Shah’s illegitimate interference in the government’s affairs. Shah’s American and British masters helped him by launching “Operation Ajax,” restoring shah to power in a coup. Dr. Mosaddegh was arrested, charged with treason, and sentenced to three years imprisonment. After his release, he was kept under house arrest for the rest of his life. Once more in charge, Mohammad Reza Shah replaced the nationalized oil company with an international oil consortium that now shared Iran’s oil riches with American companies. With US support, he launched two major programs to become the U.S. boot on the ground in the region. The first, ‘The White Revolution,’ which Shah made much fanfare of, was apparently meant to serve poor Iranian farmers. Yet, this reform from above was aimed at preserving traditional power patterns and safeguarding Shah’s rule from a restive society. The land reforms were, in fact, for the benefit of the ruling elite, and the Pahlavi family itself became the most prominent of the new commercial farmers. Many farmers couldn’t acquire any land, so they were forced to immigrate to cities’ margins and live in shanty towns. They also became cheap labor in the newly established factories. Besides, the so-called industrial farming reduced Iran’s agricultural exports, and by the early 1970s, Iran was importing many agricultural goods. Shah’s initiative, in response to American demands for more political openness in Iran, involved the creation of his Rastakhiz (Resurgence) Party, which was entirely controlled by the regime and became Iran’s only political party, turning\"\n}\n"

Full description Bibliographic Details Main Author: Doua, Amal Format: Article in Journal/Newspaper Language: English Published: University of Leicester 2017 Subjects: Film Biology Nutrition Dragon Toothless How to Train Your Dragon Atlantic salmon Online Access: https://journals.le.ac.uk/ojs1/index.php/jist/article/view/733 Description Staff View Description Summary: Toothless is a Night Fury dragon who appears in the How to Train Your Dragon (HTTYD) franchise, and is said to be the rarest, fastest, and most intelligent of the dragon species. In the 2010 film, Toothless is struck down during a dragon raid and loses his left tail-fin, leaving him trapped in a sunken area. This paper investigates the feasibility of Hiccup, a teenage boy, being able to supply enough fish to maintain the dragon’s diet by catching and bringing fish to him. It was found that in the twelve days that Toothless was trapped, he would have required 13 Icelandic cod and 56 Atlantic salmon every day, which totalled 716 kg. Hiccup would have had to carry 828 fish weighing at total of 8592 kg over the twelve days, which is unrealistic since he struggles to lift a shield in combat.

        "turn_1_webpage_analyses": "The University of Leicester paper \"Can Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon’s Diet?\" does not explicitly state the **volume** of the fish bag in cubic meters (m³) in the provided snippets of the searched web pages. However, the paper calculates the **weight** of fish required:  - Toothless (the dragon) needed **13 Icelandic cod and 56 Atlantic salmon daily**, totaling **716 kg per day**.  - Over 12 days, Hiccup would have to carry **8,592 kg of fish** (as noted in **Web Page 3**).  No direct mention of the fish bag's volume (e.g., dimensions or m³) is found in the snippets. The focus of the paper appears to be on the **weight** of fish required rather than the volume of the container. The lack of volume data aligns with comments in **Web Page 4**, **Web Page 5**, and **Web Page 8**, where attempts to retrieve the volume yielded no explicit value, prompting the need to refer directly to the full paper for further details.  **Key Takeaway for Previous Reasoning Steps:**  Proceed by either:  1. Accessing the full paper (via the provided URL in Web Page 1 or 3) to check for volume calculations not captured in snippets.  2. Inferring volume from weight if density/size assumptions about the fish or bag are made (though this is speculative without explicit data)."

This paper specifically compares pie menus with linear menus. Although other researchers have investigated similar themes it is felt that there is still not enough knowledge regarding the various effects of different menu types, including their positioning on a screen. An empirical approach using an experiment to test the effectiveness and user satisfaction of a pie menu and a linear menu is described in detail. Four tasks were administered to experimental participants under each menu design in a within users experimental design. Overall task time, number of errors and participants' subjective opinions were measured. The data were statistically analysed. There were no statistically significant results for task times and errors. However, subjective opinions were overall statistically significant, suggesting a preference for the pie menu by participants. These results are interesting for all web designers, user interface designers and developers. The issues being investigated are rather complex, because there is no clear pattern of results to suggest a categorical ‘best design’. These results add to the current knowledge in existence regarding menu types and to the wish of understanding better the issues involved with menu types.

Pull down menus are a common example of this format. Bitmapped computer displays, however, allow greater freedom in the placement, font, and general presentation of menus. A pie menu is a format where the items are placed along the circumference of a circle at equal radial distances from the center. Pie menus gain over traditional linear menus by reducing target seek time, lowering error rates by fixing the distance factor and increasing the target size in Fitts's Law, minimizing the drift distance after target selection, and are, in general, subjectively equivalent to the linear style. ...

Pie menus are circular menus subdivided into sectors, each of which might correspond to a different command. Marking menus are pie menus in which the path of the cursor leaves an ink trail. Thus, selecting a sector from a marking menu creates a visual mark similar to a pen stroke on paper. Marking menus are also unique in that they ease the transition from novice to expert user. Novices can \\\"pop-up\\\" a menu and make a selection, whereas experts can simply make the corresponding mark without waiting for the menu to appear. This paper describes an experiment designed to explore both articulatory and cognitive aspects of pie and marking menus. \\\"Articulatory aspects\\\" refers to how well subjects could execute the physical actions necessary to select from pie menus, given three different kinds of input devices (mouse, trackball, and stylus), and as the number of items in the menu increases. Articulatory aspects were investigated by presenting one group of subjects with the task of selecting from fully visible or \\\"exposed\\\" menus. To investigate the cognitive aspects, two other groups of subjects used invisible or \\\"hidden\\\" pie menus: one group with an ink trail, and one without. In order for marking menus to work effectively, users must be able to mentally represent and associate Selection from hidden menus was designed to reveal Both number of slices per menu and input device were systematically v\"\n}\n**Web Page 4:**\n{\n  \"id\": 4,\n  \"title\": \"View of A usability evaluation of Web user interface scrolling types\",\n  \"url\": \"https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/10309/9400\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Murano an d I.N.

Its popularity as a pet has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive when released into nonnative environments. This report investigates the nonnative sightings of *Amphiprion ocellaris* in the United States before 2020, as documented by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The findings are presented in the form of five-digit zip codes, as requested.\\n\\n## Methodology\\n\\nThe research process involved analyzing data from the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database and other credible sources. The focus was on identifying specific locations where *Amphiprion ocellaris* was reported as a nonnative species before 2020. The data was cross-referenced with geographic identifiers to extract zip codes. Additionally, the reliability and relevance of the sources were evaluated to ensure the accuracy of the findings.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Findings\\n\\n### 1. **Nonnative Sightings of Amphiprion ocellaris**\\n\\nThe USGS NAS database documented a single confirmed nonnative sighting of *Amphiprion ocellaris* in the United States before 2020. This sighting occurred in **Fred Howard Park**, located in Pinellas County, Florida, in July 2018. The specimen was removed and transferred to the Clearwater Marine Aquarium, and the population was declared eradicated ([clown anemonefish (Amphiprion ocellaris) - Species Profile](<url-1>); [Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database](<url-2>)).\\n\\n#### Geographic Details:\\n- **Location:** Fred Howard Park, Pinellas County, Florida\\n- **Zip Code:** 34689 ([Fred Howard Park in Tarpon Springs](<url-9>))\\n\\nThis is the only documented nonnative occurrence of *Amphiprion ocellaris* in the USGS database before 2020.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. **Ecological Context and Introduction Pathway**\\n\\n#### Ecological Impact:\\nThe ecological impact of *Amphiprion ocellaris* as a nonnative species remains unknown due to the limited number of sightings and lack of long-term studies. The species is known for its symbiotic relationship with sea anemones, which provides it with protection from predators. However, the introduction of *Amphiprion ocellaris* into nonnative environments could potentially disrupt local ecosystems, particularly if it establishes a population ([clown anemonefish (Amphiprion ocellaris)](<url-3>)).\\n\\n#### Means of Introduction:\\nThe primary pathway for the introduction of *Amphiprion ocellaris* into nonnative environments is through aquarium releases. The popularity of the species in the pet trade, driven by its association with *Finding Nemo*, has led to concerns about irresponsible pet ownership and the release of unwanted fish into the wild ([Real clownfish suffered after 'Finding Nemo,' so 'Finding Dory' raises concerns](<url-5>)).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. **Analysis of Dat\"\n}\n**Web Page 8:**\n{\n  \"id\": 8,\n  \"title\": \"[PDF] MASTER THESIS in Universal Design of ICT - OsloMet ODA\",\n  \"url\": \"https://oda.oslomet.no/oda-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2777325/khadka-mauu2021.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Murano, P., & Khan, I.

This study is about hidden navigation design patterns in websites, how different navigation designs impact the usability, and how they comply with the principles of universal design. The study has been carried out to fulfill the partial requirements of master’s degree in Information Communication Technology, Faculty of Technology, Art, and Design at Oslo Metropolitan University. The basis for this research came from my passion with design of frontend technologies in websites. As a student of universal design and a developer myself, detailed researching on the impact of hidden navigation designs, and thinking over to possibly develop an optimum solution was an interesting matter for me. Different phases of the study: studying the background, designing the prototype, finding the participants, performing experiment, and analyzing the data, were all a part of a good learning process. I am obliged to get an opportunity to study and complete my thesis under the umbrella of Department of Computer Science, Oslo Metropolitan University. My sincere gratitude and respect go to thesis supervisor Dr. Pietro Murano, for continuous guidance, unwavering support, and supervision on tiniest of the details throughout the whole study. In truth, I would not be able to complete the thesis without his contribution. I also wish to thank all the participants of the study for their time and cooperation, without whom this thesis would be incomplete. I would like to express my thankfulness all the friends, my parents and colleagues who kept me motivated. Nawaraj Khadka Student, Master’s Degree Program in Universal Design of ICT 5/13/2021, Oslo, Norway iAbstract With the implementation of different interface designs in applications across various devices, the concerns related to usability in these designs have also increased. Navigation is an important functionality in websites and the effectiveness of website is impacted by how the navigation is designed. The increase in use of hidden navigation patterns, particularly ‘hamburger’ menu icon, has raised debates regarding usability of the navigation design and the icon itself. This study seeks to investigate the usability of hamburger menu design pattern in websites, comparing the efficiency and satisfaction level of the design with two other design patterns: hidden navigation design without hamburger icon and tab navigation design. Although few studies are already there which compare the performance of hamburger menu design pattern with other design patterns in mobile applications, not much research has been made to compare the efficiency from the perspective of usability and universal design in websites. This research examines the performance of 45 people across these navigation design patterns through variations in tasks, using hypothetical deductive method. Total time taken, total errors made and opinions of participants regarding the navigation design were collected as a part of experiment. As a quantitative study, the results were analyzed using independent one-way Anova for validity, using SPSS as a tool. The findings indicate that hidden navigation design patterns are less usable, inefficient, and comply less with the principles of universal design as compared to tab navigation design. The inefficiency is more noticeable for complicated tasks. The research also pinpoints that the ‘hamburger’ icon itself is an understandable metaphor and is usable for experienced users. The outcome of the research can be beneficial for future relevant fields of research, as well as for user interface designers and experts.

It was first broadcast on BBC One on 28 November 2015. It was written by Steven Moffat and directed by Rachel Talalay . In the episode, the alien time traveller the Twelfth Doctor is imprisoned in a waterlocked castle by his people, the Time Lords . A shrouded creature pursues the Doctor in an attempt to interrogate truths from him. The episode is a bottle episode that primarily features the Doctor without a companion or any guest speaking characters. It was watched by 6.19 million viewers in the United Kingdom. \\\"Heaven Sent\\\" received universal acclaim, with praise for Capaldi's performance, Moffat's script, and Talalay's direction. Many labelled the episode the strongest of the ninth series and one of the strongest of the show overall. It was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form) . The episode was voted the best Doctor Who story ever by readers of Doctor Who Magazine in 2023. Plot [ edit ] The Twelfth Doctor is teleported into a glass chamber within an empty castle in the sea. He is pursued by a cloaked veiled figure, [ N 1 ] which evokes the Doctor's childhood fears. When the figure corners the Doctor, he admits he is afraid to die. The figure halts and the castle reconfigures itself. The Doctor jumps out of a window into the sea, finding many skulls under the water. The Doctor concludes that the castle is a torture chamber. He takes advantage of the figure's slow reaction time to explore the castle, finding several strange remnants of his predecessors, such as dry replacement clothes, a skull connected to the transportation chamber, and the word \\\"bird\\\" written in dust. The Doctor investigates clues left in the castle, directing him to find Room 12. He delays the figure by alleging knowledge of \\\"the Hybrid\\\"; the movement of the reconfiguring castle causes the skull to fall into the sea. The shrouded figure, referred to as the \\\"Veil\\\" in the credits, as shown at the Doctor Who Experience. Inside Room 12, the Doctor discovers a wall of azbantium; a mineral harder than diamond, behind which he theorises the TARDIS to be. He realises that \\\"bird\\\" refers to \\\" The Shepherd Boy \\\", a fairytale by the Brothers Grimm in which a shepherd's boy says to an Emperor that a second of eternity will have passed when a bird chisels a diamond mountain down to nothing with its beak. The Doctor temporarily despairs following an epiphany: the prison was made solely for him, and thus the skulls were his own and he has been in the castle for 7000 years. Revitalised by a vision of his dead companion , Clara , the Doctor punches the wall while reciting the fable. The figure mortally injures the Doctor, disabling his regeneration . He crawls back to the teleportation chamber, and burns his body as a catalyst to restart the teleport, aware that due to the resetting rooms, a \\\"blueprint\\\" of himself is inside. He then falls to the ground, writes \\\"bird\\\" in the dust, and disintegrates, reduced to the skull which the Doctor had seen earlier. A new Doctor appears, starting the cycle anew. After many more cycles, [ N 2 ] the Doctor finally breaks through the wall. He finds himself outside the Capitol on Gallifrey ; the castle was in his confession dial. [ N 3 ] The Doctor tells a young boy to tell the Time Lords that he is on his way and that he knows what they did. He then proclaims the Hybrid prophesied by the Time Lords is \\\"Me\\\". [ 1 ] [ N 4 ] Continuity [ edit ] As he walks down the corridor, the Doctor says to his unseen adversary \\\"the Doctor will see you now\\\". The Eleventh Doctor shouts this same line to the Atraxi in \\\" The Eleventh Hour \\\" (2010). [ 2 ] The Doctor tells himself \\\"Assume you're going to survive. Always assume that.\\\" This is what Clara says of the Doctor in \\\" T\"\n}\n**Web Page 2:**\n{\n  \"id\": 2,\n  \"title\": \"[PDF] DW9 - EP 11 Heaven Sent BLUE 240815.fdx - BBC\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.bbc.co.uk/writers/documents/doctor-who-s9-ep11-heaven-sent-steven-moffat.pdf\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"E1: Veil, in confrontation with the Doctor, the Doctor making his first confession.

Sprinkles of blood, streaks of it, like someone, terribly injured has been hauling themselves along. THE DOCTOR (cont’d) (V.O.) You will run - it will walk. You will rest - it will not.

Heaven Sent was the eleventh and penultimate episode of series 9 of Doctor Who . The episode shows the Doctor dealing with and grieving over the death of Clara Oswald , whom he lost to the Quantum Shade in the previous episode . The vast majority of the episode includes just the Doctor by himself with no other characters present, save the veiled figure that menaces him throughout. Jenna Coleman appears only as a manifestation of Clara in the Doctor's imagination. The Doctor's TARDIS is also absent from this episode, except again in the Doctor's imagination. The episode is notable for a number of truths conceded by the Doctor, with him being inside his own confession dial . It is also notable for showing the Doctor finally finding his way back to Gallifrey since he found out that it was not in fact destroyed in the Time War , but instead placed in a pocket universe . This story takes place over an outstandingly long period of time, seeing the Doctor stuck in a recursive cycle during which he repeatedly perishes and comes back to life. In the following episode, Hell Bent , it is estimated that this cycle lasts for four and a half billion years, leaving it with one of the single-longest uninterrupted time spans of any given adventure in Doctor Who history. In a 2023 poll by Doctor Who Magazine , Heaven Sent was ranked as the second most popular Twelfth Doctor TV story behind the two-parter World Enough and Time / The Doctor Falls [ 1 ] [ nb 1 ] . In another DWM poll later that year, Heaven Sent was declared the most popular TV story of the first 60 years of Doctor Who , followed by World Enough and Time / The Doctor Falls .

Just Wow. As far as I'm concerned,this episode is the best episode in all of new Who, maybe all of Who even. I haven't felt the gamut of emotions that I felt watching this episode since Breaking Bad's Ozymandias. I was left absolutely speechless. Capaldi's performance here is just breathtaking. The various emotional transitions are seamless and it never comes across as too studied. It was very atmospheric and immersive. Each frame seemed lovingly crafted and the music was a character by itself. Murray Gold exceeded himself here. This is an absolute masterpiece with great writing, directing and acting (Give all of them BAFTA's already). It's one of the episodes that I can point out and say proudly - That's why I watch Doctor Who. Bravo, everyone involved! Just amazing! 9 chasesunning This is why Capaldi is The Doctor This episode is for me a standout of not only the season but as capaldis turn as the twelfth Doctor. He rules the screen with perfect delivery and intensity by doing things his own way, and not relying on any previous incarnation. He is a true actor. This episode is a crowning achievement from start to finish. The Doctor is pushed to his limits and he is forced to confront long buried truths that he has always ran from. Capaldi makes you feel his pain and his absolute power as the time lord (it's a joy to watch). I will always remember one particular scene from this episode showcasing what capaldis Doctor and what being the doctor is all about. The 12th Doctor is a very different man than he previously was. And this is the episode that shows you why he is the way he is. Capaldi you are The Doctor. 10 James0987 This should solidify Moffat as the best writer of Who If I hear one more person complaining about Moffat... This episode was absolutely incredible, this is peak DW right here.

Welcome back to the eleventh Doctor Who Review, where I recap the week’s episode and give some thoughts and opinions on it. Please do not read if you have not seen this week’s episode. There are major spoilers ahead. You have been warned. What is Doctor Who Season 9 Episode 11 about? Title: Heaven Sent Written by: Stephen Moffat We ended last week’s episode, Face the Raven , with Clara dying and the Doctor being transported up and away to some unknown location. This week’s episode, Heaven Sent, picks up where that one left off, and we see the Doctor stepping out of the teleporter and into the halls of a castle. After a quick look around, the Doctor stumbles across a shovel leaning against the wall, to which he says something about hating gardening, and tries to figure out just where he is. It’s a castle, yes, but it could be a maze, or a puzzle, or anything. Are there other people too? No, but yes. The Veil, a new monster, is the thing nightmares are made of. Think The Lord of the Rings Black Riders…only with flies. The Doctor recalls a woman he saw when he was a child, who had a veil and was covered in flies. It turns out that that image has taken form, and the Doctor is chased (albeit, slowly) around the castle. At one point he manages to freeze the Veil as it’s hands are outstretched before him, and says something to make it back off. But it eventually finds him in a room with a portrait of Clara, and instead of sticking around to be killed, he jumps out a window. He’s falling falling falling, and suddenly he’s in the TARDIS having a conversation with Clara, and we find out that that’s his thought process as he falls. After a few more of these chats, the Doctor figures out that the Veil wants not just the truth, but confessions. In this episode, due to the confessions the Doctor must tell in order not to die, we learn that the Doctor didn’t leave Gallifrey out of boredom, but fear. Another thing we learn is that he knows what and where the Hybrid (which has been mentioned at all seasons, the prophecy taking place at the beginning) is. He eventually finds a 20-foot thick wall of stone harder than diamond and sees ‘Home’ on the other side. With the Veil closing in, and a moral support conversation with Clara in his head, he throws a punch at the wall, and the Veil gets him. Time Lords die more slowly than us mere Muggles, so as he dies, he crawls back up to the teleport to get it working again … and it resets itself, like the rest of the rooms in the castle, and the Doctor goes back to the way he was when he first arrived. It turns out that the cycle we have seen, 7,000 years in the future, is one of millions. Each time the Doctor gets to the stone wall, he punches it, and each time everything resets, and he does it again. After millions and millions of years doing this, he finally punches through and reveals … Gallifrey! It falls no more! Well, it might, because that Hybrid that has been mentioned all season, that one that was prophesied as being half Dalek, half Time Lord…? Turns out it isn’t, and the Doctor knows that. His last words are: “The hybrid destined to conquer Gallifrey and stand in its ruins … is  me.” Crazy times! I really liked this episode. I thought it was very clever, and very well written. I loved the fact that it was essentially a one-man episode. I feel like the Veil doesn’t really count, neither does Clara because she’s just in the Doctor’s mind. Peter Capaldi excelled once more, and I find him best in monologues and big giant speeches, of which the whole episode basically was. The montage of repeated sequence shots was so intense, and while it felt like it went on for a bit, it was so good, and a really fantastic build up to the grand scene of Gallifrey at the end. A couple of things to think about: Is the Doctor really the hybrid? If so, what’s the other half? There’s a part where the Doctor finds a full set of clothes lying out for him to change from his wet ones. We then find, when we realise that it’s a loop, that it’s actually his clothes there, from the past death. But my question is … where did the first extra set of clothes come from? The first time he died/reset, there wouldn’t have been clothes there, unless they were they put there by the person who sent him there? And then the room resets with the clothes already inside it? His exact clothes? Also … where does the food come from? I don’t know. Ah well. Favourite lines: “Are you gardeners? I hate gardening! What sort of person has a power complex about flowers? It’s a dictatorship for inadequates.” “Physics of a triangle! You lose!” Next week’s episode is the last until Christmas (I can’t believe it!), and it’s called Hell Bent . Really looking forward to it! I feel like this season has definitely built up in goodness. I really wasn’t loving the first half of the season, but these past few episodes have been really great.

It's probably tough to come up with ways to keep a show fresh, especially one that's been around for fifty years (give or take) like this one. So I don't mind when the series occasionally tries something different and breaks from the traditional formula. That said, I am not a fan of so-called \\\"one man shows.\\\" No matter how well such shows are written, no matter how good the actor may be, they're always the same-- a guy in a room talking to himself for an hour or so, with little or no action. I find such one man shows dull and sleep-inducing. The actor usually senses this, and starts chewing the scenery with gusto in order to keep the audience awake. For the record I didn't fall asleep during this episode, but it was definitely talky, there was no action, and the scenery was well-digested by the end. I've been very critical of showrunner Steven Moffat the past couple of years, and with good reason. His scripts are usually overly complicated and convoluted to the point of incoherence. It's almost like he comes up with three of four \\\"cool\\\" scenes first, and then tries to think of a way to string them together. Not so with this episode. It's tightly written, and actually makes a certain amount of sense as it methodically doles out information, allowing the audience to slowly realize what's going on. Kudos where kudos are due. There's a very troubling revelation at the end, and I really hope Moffat isn't heading where I think he's heading. I guess we'll find out next week in the season finale. SPOILERS, OBVIOUSLY! The Plot: Picking up where we left off last week (in Face The Raven ), the Doctor materializes in a teleportation chamber, located inside Hogwarts, er, I mean a castle whose rooms are constantly shifting. The castle's located in the middle of a vast sea, making escape impossible. Scattered throughout the castle are large video monitors, showing the point of view of a large, shambling creature the Doctor names \\\"The Veil.\\\" It slowly but relentlessly pursues him throughout the castle. At one point the Doctor is cornered by The Veil, and just as it's about to grab his face in its clawed hands, he confesses that he's afraid to die. This causes the creature to freeze. Hogwarts then reconfigures itself, and the Doctor escapes. He's cornered again and this time dives out a window, landing in the ocean far below. He notices the ocean floor is littered with millions of skulls from the previous victims of the creature (this is our first big clue as to what's going on). The Doctor returns to the castle and finds a courtyard with a fresh grave and a spade nearby. He digs up the grave and finds a stone with the message \\\"I AM IN 12\\\" chiseled into it. The sun sets and the Doctor tries to work out where he is by the position of the stars. However the constellations don't match any location within the teleporter's range. The Veil appears again, and the Doctor stops it by confessing he didn't leave Gallifrey because he was bored , but because he was scared . He realizes that the purpose of the castle is to force confessions from him. The Doctor notices that whenever he reenters a room, it's been reset to its original state, and any changes he made are gone, Groundhog Day -style (clue!). He finally finds the door to Room 12, but when he opens it, it's blocked by a brick wall. He returns to the teleport room where he first arrived. He sees a skull lying on the floor, along with the word \\\"bird\\\" written in the dirt (more clues!). He walks to the top of the castle (carrying the skull) and looks at the stars. He notes that their positions are 7,000 years off, even though he's sure he hasn't time traveled. He places the skull on the edge of the castle wall, where if falls into the sea far below (BIG clue!). The Veil appears again, and the Doctor confesses he knows what the Hybrid is (the mysterious figure prophesied by the Time Lords) and where to find it. This freezes The Veil and reconfigures the castle, The Doctor can now get into Room 12. Inside he sees the way out, but it's barred by a wall of Azbantium (a material four hundred times harder than diamond) that's twenty feet thick. He realizes that the \\\"bird\\\" written in the dirt is a reference to The Shepherd Boy story (more on that below). The Doctor begins punching at the Azbantium wall, until The Veil catches up with him. It grabs his face, severely burning him (which curiously doesn't cause him to regenerate). Mortally injured, he crawls back to the teleport room. He hooks the teleporter up to his head so his body's energy will power it. He then scrawls the word \\\"bird\\\" into the dirt and pulls the lever. His body is disintegrated (except, for some reason, his skull) as it powers the teleporter. A brand new copy of the Doctor appears inside the teleporter, fresh from his adventure in Face The Raven , and starts the whole cycle all over again. The Doctor goes through the cycle for billions of years, slowly chipping away at the Azbantium wall (which oddly enough does NOT reset itself each time he starts over) until he breaks through. He exits onto his home planet of Gallifrey, and sees the castle shrink into his Confession Dial, which plops to the ground. He realizes the Time Lords were behind his billion year torture. He tells a passing boy to tell the Time Lords that he's returned. He says to himself (and us) that the Hybrid prophesied to destroy Gallifrey \\\"is ME!\\\" Thoughts: • So it looks like the Doctor is this mysterious Hybrid we've been hearing about all season. The Hybrid's halves are supposed to be made of two warrior races, presumably the Daleks and the T\"\n}\n"

The scene begins with the Doctor’s voiceover (\"As you come into this world...\") and establishes the castle’s labyrinthine nature, setting the stage for his ordeal. The location is later revealed to be within the Doctor’s confession dial, a prison created by the Time Lords."

Need help asap (x post r/geography) I need to find the distance between all of the European capital cities and 86 other countries for an economic model I am developing. However, it took me roughly an hour to document the distance between London and the 86 countries I'm testing alone, I have to do this 25 more time and I don't want it to take 25 more hours to complete this research. Does anyone know of a database or a website where I can put in one testable city, and then multiple subsequent cities, and have the distance between the original city and the subsequent cities be shown in a table or csv form? Any help would be highly appreciated! Thanks! I have an excel file I can gladly send you with the specific cities I need.

It decomposes the margins of trade and regulatory distance by sector (agriculture and manufacturing) and NTM type (technical, non-technical, sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS), technical barriers to trade (TBTs), and pre-shipment inspections and other measures) for the 15 countries. At the country level, the results indicate a varying regulatory distance amongst the ASEAN+5 countries. Regulatory implementation also varies by sector and by the type of measure. Within sectors, SPS regulatory distance is higher in the agriculture sector, while for manufacturing, the regulatory distance in TBTs is higher. Notably, few countries recorded a higher regulatory distance for non-technical measures and pre-shipment inspections. Interestingly, for the ASEAN region, there seems to be no evidence supporting a reduction in regulatory distance from 2015 to 2018, despite efforts to harmonise NTMs since 2015. The results indicate that regulatory distance largely has a trade-reducing effect along the trade margins within ASEAN+5 bilateral trade. Technical measures have a greater trade-reducing effect than other measures along extensive and intensive trade margins – specifically SPS in the agriculture sector and TBTs in the manufacturing sector. Notably, there is also evidence of non-technical measures and pre-shipments and other formalities impacting trade along extensive margins, despite efforts to establish trade facilitation. The paper also describes some policy implications.

The authors are deeply indebted to the members of this project for their invaluable suggestions. The opinions expressed in this paper are the sole responsibility of the authors and do not reflect the views of ERIA.1. Introduction The theoretical relationship between non-tariff measures (NTMs) and trade remains ambiguous. Stringent NTMs can impose additional costs on exporters, which in the context of models in the spirit of Melitz (2003) would raise the fixed costs of firms, leading to the exit of the least productive exporters from the market, and potentially impacting exports along both the extensive margins (number of firms) and intensive (average exports per firm) margins. NTMs may further raise the variable costs of exporting, which could again force firms to cease exporting, reducing exports along both margins. Conversely, the exit of the least productive firms from exporting may lead to a reallocation of resources towards more productive firms, which could then increase exports, especially if these firms are able to signal quality through meeting the standard-like measures1 of NTMs. However, NTMs affect margins of trade not only through their inherent stringency, but also through their non-harmonisation, implementation, and procedures (Cadot et al., 2015; Disdier, Fontagné, and Cadot, 2015; Reyes, 2012; Czubala, Shepherd, and Wilson, 2009; Chen and Mattoo, 2008).

It is also a region with intense internal disparities and a landscape that has been and continues to be transformed by physical, political, and economic forces. Although East and Southeast Asia are often divided into two regions, they share a common economic and political history and global geopolitical forces continue to transform this realm. Figure 9.1: Map of East and Southeast Asia (CIA World Factbook, Public Domain) The region of East and Southeast Asia is divided from the rest of Asia by a number of formidable physical barriers (see Figure 9.2 ). In the north, Mongolia’s Altay Mountains, the Mongolian Plateau, and the Gobi Desert separate the region from Russia. In the south, the Himalaya Mountains divide China from South Asia and contain the world’s highest mountain, Mount Everest. These mountains are so high, in fact, that they form the Gobi Desert by preventing rainfall from passing over South Asia into Central Asia. In the southeast, the Arkan Mountains and Naga Hills, which stretch across Myanmar and India, and the rolling hills of China’s Yunnan Plateau separate Southeast Asia from the rest of the continent. In general, this is a realm of relatively high relief, meaning there are significant changes in elevation on the landscape. Even the islands of this region have a rugged topography, from Japan’s Mount Fuji to Indonesia’s Mount Carstensz. Figure 9.2: Physical Map of East and Southeast Asia (CIA World Factbook, Public Domain) The rivers of this region have supported both ancient cultures and modern societies providing irrigation for agriculture, river transportation, and in some cases,  hydropower. Asia’s longest river, the Yangtze, flows through central China; the economic activity surrounding its river valley generates around one-fifth of the entire country’s gross domestic product (GDP). In 2003, the Chinese government built the Three Gorges Dam, the world’s largest hydroelectric power station, which spans the river. China’s other major river, the Huang He River, also known as the Yellow River, flows through the highlands of Western China before discharging in Northeastern China. It was on the banks of the Huang He that Chinese civilization first began. In Southeast Asia, the region is dominated by the Mekong and Irrawaddy Rivers. The Mekong River, one of the most biodiverse rivers in the world, has been heavily dammed, impacting the area’s ecology, and plans are underway to dam the Irrawaddy in several places. In addition, both the Mekong and the Irrawaddy originate in China, presenting issues over river flow and ownership. Although the construction of the region’s numerous dams has provided reliable power, they’ve been met with significant social and ecological impacts. The Three Gorges Dam, for example, was an unprecedented engineering marvel and will reduce the potential for downstream flooding, but flooding from the creation of the dam displaced over one million people and significantly reduced forest area around the river.\"\n}\n**Web Page 6:**\n{\n  \"id\": 6,\n  \"title\": \"ASEAN - Wikipedia\",\n  \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Together, its member states represent a population of more than 600 million people and land area of over 4.5 million km2 (1.7 million sq mi).

It consists of two dissimilar portions: a continental projection (commonly called mainland Southeast Asia) and a string of archipelagoes to the south and east of the mainland (insular Southeast Asia). Extending some 700 miles (1,100 km) southward from the mainland into insular Southeast Asia is the Malay Peninsula ; this peninsula structurally is part of the mainland, but it also shares many ecological and cultural affinities with the surrounding islands and thus functions as a bridge between the two regions. Mainland Southeast Asia is divided into the countries of Cambodia , Laos , Myanmar (Burma), Thailand , Vietnam , and the small city-state of Singapore at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula; Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, which occupy the eastern portion of the mainland, often are collectively called the Indochinese Peninsula. Malaysia is both mainland and insular, with a western portion on the Malay Peninsula and an eastern part on the island of Borneo . Except for the small sultanate of Brunei (also on Borneo), the remainder of insular Southeast Asia consists of the archipelagic nations of Indonesia and the Philippines . Southeast Asia stretches some 4,000 miles at its greatest extent (roughly from northwest to southeast) and encompasses some 5,000,000 square miles (13,000,000 square km) of land and sea, of which about 1,736,000 square miles is land. Mount Hkakabo in northern Myanmar on the border with China, at 19,295 feet (5,881 meters), is the highest peak of mainland Southeast Asia. Although the modern nations of the region are sometimes thought of as being small, they are—with the exceptions of Singapore and Brunei—comparatively large. Indonesia, for example, is more than 3,000 miles from west to east (exceeding the west-east extent of the continental United States) and more than 1,000 miles from north to south; the area of Laos is only slightly smaller than that of the United Kingdom; and Myanmar is considerably larger than France. All of Southeast Asia falls within the tropical and subtropical climatic zones, and much of it receives considerable annual precipitation. It is subject to an extensive and regular monsoonal weather system (i.e., one in which the prevailing winds reverse direction every six months) that produces marked wet and dry periods in most of the region. Southeast Asia’s landscape is characterized by three intermingled physical elements: mountain ranges, plains and plateaus, and water in the form of both shallow seas and extensive drainage systems.

PMC Copyright notice PMCID: PMC8363119  NIHMSID: NIHMS1721416 PMID: 34370395 Abstract PubChem ( https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ) is a public chemical database that serves scientific communities as well as the general public. This database collects chemical information from hundreds of data sources and organizes them into multiple data collections, including Substance, Compound, BioAssay, Protein, Gene, Pathway, and Patent. These collections are interlinked with each other, allowing users to discover related records in the various collections (e.g., drugs targeting a protein or genes modulated by a chemical). PubChem can be searched by keyword (e.g., a chemical, protein, or gene name) as well as by chemical structure. The input structure can be provided using popular line notations or drawn with the PubChem Sketcher. PubChem supports various types of structure searches, including identity search, 2‐D and 3‐D similarity searches, and substructure and superstructure searches. Results from multiple searches can be combined using Boolean operators (i.e., AND, OR, and NOT) to formulate complex queries. PubChem allows the user to quickly retrieve a list of records annotated with a particular classification or ontological term. This paper provides step‐by‐step instructions on how to explore PubChem data with examples of commonly requested tasks. © 2021.

With millions of unique users every month, PubChem is a very popular chemistry information resource for biomedical research communities in many areas, including cheminformatics, chemical biology, medicinal chemistry, and drug discovery. Importantly, PubChem also serves as a source of big data in chemistry, used in many machine learning and data science projects for virtual screening, computational toxicology, drug repurposing, etc. PubChem's information content, collected from hundreds of data sources, is organized into multiple data collections, including Substance, Compound, BioAssay, Gene, Protein, Pathway, and Patent (Kim et al., 2021 ). Substance archives the chemical data submitted by individual data sources and Compound stores the unique chemical structures extracted from Substance through chemical structure standardization (Hähnke, Kim, & Bolton, 2018 ; Kim et al., 2016 ). BioAssay contains biological assay descriptions and test results deposited by assay data providers. The record identifiers (IDs) used in Substance, Compound, and BioAssay are called Substance ID (SID), Compound ID (CID), and Assay ID (AID), respectively. The other data collections (i.e., Gene, Protein, Pathway, and Patent) provide alternative views of PubChem data, related to a specific gene, protein, pathway, and patent document, respectively. Each record in the data collections has a dedicated web page (called a Summary page), which presents information available in PubChem for that record. This page also presents relevant annotations collected by PubChem from authoritative data sources.

Describing such devices as the mapping out of a comprehensive series of abstract models for charting the relationships between a translated and a translating text (in the case of John Trevisa) and the construction of an authorial idiolect where no autograph survives (in the case of Thomas Hoccleve), the personal narrative now regards these attempts to reach back into the authorial psyche as hubristic, even improper.

For Speed Hill 1 I tried to find, and be loyal to, an author: I really did. But somehow the \\\"psychic connections\\\" that my fellow-panelists identified, never quite took with me.

This is not to say that we should cease to establish facts and to verify our information, but merely to suggest that unless those facts can be imbued with the flash of poetic insight then they remain dull gems; semi-precious stones scarcely worth the collecting. — DANIEL DREIBERG, “BLOOD FROM THE SHOULDER OF PALLAS” CONTENTS List of Illustrations xi Acknowledgments xiii Abbreviations xxi Introduction: “Not Like an Arrow, but a Boomerang,” or The Lifecycles of Twentieth-Century African American Literary Papers 1 1 Black Special Collections and the Midcentury Rise of the Institutional Collector 39 2 Claude McKay’s Archival Rebirth: Provenance and Politics in Amiable with Big Teeth 95 3 “At Once Both Document and Symbol”: Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, and the Lafargue Clinic Photographic Archive 4 An Interlude Concerning the Vanishing Manuscripts of Ann Petry 209 5 “Too Obscure for Learned Classification”: Comic Books, Counterculture, and Archival Invisibility in Invisible Man Coda.

Die moderne Forschung sieht das Werk als eine wichtige zeithistorische Quelle für die Geschichte des 5. und 6. Jahrhunderts n. Chr., die auch Einblicke in kultur- und mentalitätsgeschichtliche Aspekte erlaubt. Trotz steigenden Forschungsinteresses sind viele grundlegende Fragen nach wie vor offen: Welche Ausbildung hat Malalas durchlaufen, woran hat er geglaubt? In welche Gattung gehört sein Werk, das gemeinhin Chronik ge- nannt wird? Kann mittels anderer Textzeugnisse der verlorene Urtext des Malalas erschlossen werden? Die Weltchronik Im ersten Band der Malalas-Studien, der die Ergebnisse der Auftakttagung des Tübinger Projektes zur historischen und philologischen Kommentierung des Johannes Malalas der Chronik präsentiert, werden insbesondere drei Schwerpunkte beleuch- tet: die Frage nach der Person des Autors, nach der Überlieferung seiner Chronik und der mittelalterlichen (mehrsprachigen) Malalas-Tradition Autor – Werk – Überlieferung sowie die Frage nach der Gattung der Chronik und ihrer zeitgeschichtlichen sowie intellektuellen Verankerung. zluhcs / iktdar / reiem mischa meier christine radtki / / fabian schulz hg.

        "turn_1_webpage_analyses": "The article by David Greetham, *\"Uncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)\"* (Textual Cultures, 2008, pp. 45-46), discusses his personal journey in textual scholarship and critiques the quest for authorial intent. Key points include:  1. **Attempted Authorial Search**: Greetham recounts his early editorial work on John Trevisa’s translation of *De Proprietatibus Rerum*, where he tried to construct an authorial identity for Trevisa through abstract models of translation. He later views these efforts as \"too-neat, too pat, and perhaps too pretentious,\" recognizing them as hubristic.  2. **Shift from Authorship to Authoriality**: He abandoned the pursuit of a singular \"author\" (e.g., Trevisa as a \"father figure\") and instead embraced \"authoriality\"—the broader, interdisciplinary engagement with texts. This shift influenced his role in founding the Society for Textual Scholarship.  3. **Critique of Author-Centric Editing**: The essay reflects on the limitations of traditional editorial practices focused on reconstructing an author’s psyche, advocating instead for methodologies that prioritize textual and contextual analysis over speculative psychological reconstruction.  These insights directly address the content of pages 45–46, aligning with the article’s focus on decoupling editorial practice from the search for a definitive authorial presence.  **Source**: Content extracted from Web Pages 1 and 2 (Project MUSE and PDF versions of the article).

Submit Menu Close Menu Deep Learning Semantic Segmentation Tutorials Mask R-CNN with OpenCV by Adrian Rosebrock on November 19, 2018 Click here to download the source code to this post In this tutorial, you will learn how to use Mask R-CNN with OpenCV. Using Mask R-CNN you can automatically segment and construct pixel-wise masks for every object in an image. We’ll be applying Mask R-CNNs to both images and video streams. In last week’s blog post you learned how to use the YOLO object detector to detect the presence of objects in images. Object detectors, such as YOLO, Faster R-CNNs, and Single Shot Detectors (SSDs), generate four sets of (x, y) -coordinates which represent the bounding box of an object in an image. Obtaining the bounding boxes of an object is a good start but the bounding box itself doesn’t tell us anything about (1) which pixels belong to the foreground object and (2) which pixels belong to the background. That begs the question: Is it possible to generate a mask for each object in our image, thereby allowing us to segment the foreground object from the background? Is such a method even possible? The answer is yes — we just need to perform instance segmentation using the Mask R-CNN architecture. To learn how to apply Mask R-CNN with OpenCV to both images and video streams, just keep reading! Looking for the source code to this post? Jump Right To The Downloads Section Mask R-CNN with OpenCV In the first part of this tutorial, we’ll discuss the difference between image classification , object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation . From there we’ll briefly review the Mask R-CNN architecture and its connections to Faster R-CNN. I’ll then show you how to apply Mask R-CNN with OpenCV to both images and video streams. Let’s get started! Instance segmentation vs. Semantic segmentation Figure 1: Image classification ( top-left ), object detection ( top-right ), semantic segmentation ( bottom-left ), and instance segmentation ( bottom-right ). We’ll be performing instance segmentation with Mask R-CNN in this tutorial. ( source ) Explaining the differences between traditional image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation is best done visually. When performing traditional image classification our goal is to predict a set of labels to characterize the contents of an input image ( top-left ). Object detection builds on image classification, but this time allows us to localize each object in an image. The image is now characterized by: Bounding box (x, y) -coordinates for each object An associated class label for each bounding box An example of semantic segmentation can be seen in bottom-left . Semantic segmentation algorithms require us to associate every pixel in an input image with a class label (including a class label for the background). Pay close attention to our semantic segmentation visualization — notice how each object is indeed segmented but each “cube” object has the same color. While semantic segmentation algorithms are capable of labeling every object in an image they cannot differentiate between two objects of the same class. This behavior is especially problematic if two objects of the same class are partially occluding each other — we have no idea where the boundaries of one object ends and the next one begins, a\"\n}\n**Web Page 6:**\n{\n  \"id\": 6,\n  \"title\": \"opencv-contrib-python - PyPI\",\n  \"url\": \"https://pypi.org/project/opencv-contrib-python/\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"The change effectively dropped support for older than 10.13 macOS versions. Starting from 4.3.0 and 3.4.10 builds the Linux build environment was updated from ...\",\n  \"context\": \" Q: Do I need to install also OpenCV separately? A: No, the packages are special wheel binary packages and they already contain statically built OpenCV binaries. Q: Pip install fails with ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'skbuild' ? Since opencv-python version 4.3.0.*, manylinux1 wheels were replaced by manylinux2014 wheels. If your pip is too old, it will try to use the new source distribution introduced in 4.3.0.38 to manually build OpenCV because it does not know how to install manylinux2014 wheels. However, source build will also fail because of too old pip because it does not understand build dependencies in pyproject.toml . To use the new manylinux2014 pre-built wheels (or to build from source), your pip version must be >= 19.3. Please upgrade pip with pip install --upgrade pip . Q: Import fails on Windows: ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found. ? A: If the import fails on Windows, make sure you have Visual C++ redistributable 2015 installed. If you are using older Windows version than Windows 10 and latest system updates are not installed, Universal C Runtime might be also required. Windows N and KN editions do not include Media Feature Pack which is required by OpenCV. If you are using Windows N or KN edition, please install also Windows Media Feature Pack . If you have Windows Server 2012+, media DLLs are probably missing too; please install the Feature called \\\"Media Foundation\\\" in the Server Manager. Beware, some posts advise to install \\\"Windows Server Essentials Media Pack\\\", but this one requires the \\\"Windows Server Essentials Experience\\\" role, and this role will deeply affect your Windows Server configuration (by enforcing active directory integration etc.); so just installing the \\\"Media Foundation\\\" should be a safer choice. If the above does not help, check if you are using Anaconda. Old Anaconda versions have a bug which causes the error, see this issue for a manual fix. If you still encounter the error after you have checked all the previous solutions, download Dependencies and open the cv2.pyd (located usually at C:\\\\Users\\\\username\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Programs\\\\Python\\\\PythonXX\\\\Lib\\\\site-packages\\\\cv2 ) file with it to debug missing DLL issues. Q: I have some other import errors? A: Make sure you have removed old manual installations of OpenCV Python bindings (cv2.so or cv2.pyd in site-packages). Q: Function foo() or method bar() returns wrong result, throws exception or crashes interpreter. What should I do? A: The repository contains only OpenCV-Python package build scripts, but not OpenCV itself. Python bindings for OpenCV are developed in official OpenCV repository and it's the best place to report issues. Also please check OpenCV wiki and the official OpenCV forum before file new bugs. Q: Why the packages do not include non-free algorithms? A: Non-free algorithms such as SURF are not included in these packages because they are patented / non-free and therefore cannot be distributed as built binaries. Note that SIFT is included in the builds due to patent expiration since OpenCV versions 4.3.0 and 3.4.10.

Abstract The Harlequin Shrimp Hymenocera picta is abundant in the Indo-Pacific and Central Pacific regions, but there are few reports of it from the eastern Pacific.Â  Two pairs of the Harlequin Shrimp were observed feeding on the Sea Star Phataria unifascialis (Gray, 1840) in the reefs of Huatulco National Park, Mexican Pacific.Â  This paper reports the occurrence of H. picta in Mexican Pacific waters and extends its previous distribution by 1,270km north of El Ocotal, Costa Rica in the eastern Pacific equatorial zone.Â  In addition, we evaluate the potential distribution of H. picta along the tropical eastern Pacific using the Maximum-Entropy modelling algorithm.

Keywords: Caridea, coral reefs, harlequin shrimp, Huatulco National Park, sea star predator. Hymenocera Latreille, 1819 is a monospecific genus that contains Hymenocera picta Dana, 1852, commonly known as “Harlequin Shrimp” or “Painted Shrimp”. Hymenocera is a small decapod crustacean (~5cm in TL) belonging to the superfamily Palaemonoidea Rafinesque, 1815 sensu De Grave & Fransen (2011).  Due to its amazing coloration, it is one of the most in-demand decapod crustacean species in the marine ornamental trade, reaching up to 80 USD per pair (Calado et al . 2003). Hymenocera picta was first described by Dana based on a specimen collected in Raraka, Tuamotu, French Polynesia.  Dana’s figures were made from a living specimen; however, holotype specimens were lost in the wreck of the “Peacock” (Edmondson 1923).  This event led to the complex and problematic taxonomy for the species (Edmondson 1923).  Previously, two nominal species were recognized: Hymenocera elegans Heller, 1862 was described as a species with a white or creamy body with blue or brown blotches with a distribution within the Indo-west Pacific (Debelius 1999), while H. picta differed in the colour of its blotches (wine or red) and with a distribution in the central and eastern Pacific (Hoover 1998).  Kawamoto & Okuno (2003) found both colour patterns in Okinawa, Japan suggesting the blotch colour changes according to the species’ diet.  As a consequence, H. elegans was re-designated as a junior synonym of H. picta (De Grave & Fransen 2011). The Harlequin Shrimp is a monogamous and territorial species that typically live in pairs inhabiting shallow waters and associated with holes, crevices and caves in coral reefs (Wickler 1973).  The most particular characteristic of the species is its unique coloration (red or blue blotches in the body), and the morphology of the chela (Debelius 1999).  Feeding habits of the Harlequin Shrimp are based exclusively on starfish of the Class Asteroidea Blainville, 1830 (Wickler 1973; Prakash & Kumar 2013), being currently referred to as an important biological control of Fromia monilis (Perrier, 1869), Linckia laevigata (Linnaeus, 1758), Mithrodia fisheri Holly, 1932, Asteropsis carinifera (Lamarck, 1816), Nidorellia armata (Gray, 1840), and Acanthaster planci (Linnaeus, 1758) populations (Wickler 1973; Juncker & Poupin 2009; Prakash & Kumar 2013). Although Hymenocera picta is abundant in the Indo-Pacific regions (Wickler 1973; Seibt & Wickler 1979; Prakash & Kumar 2013), it has also been recorded in the eastern tropical Pacific in the Galapagos Island (Hickman & Zimmerman 2000), Gorgona Island, Colombia (Juan Felipe La\"\n}\n**Web Page 6:**\n{\n  \"id\": 6,\n  \"title\": \"[PDF] Scaling Test-time Compute for LLM Agents - arXiv\",\n  \"url\": \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12928\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"What integer-rounded percentage of the total length of the harlequin shrimp recorded in Omar Valencfia-Mendez 2017 ...

Inthiswork,weconductthefirstsystematicexplorationofapplying test-time scaling methods to language agents and investigate the extent to which it improves their effectiveness. Specifically, we explore different test-time scaling strategies, including: (1) parallel sampling algorithms; (2) sequential revision strategies; (3) verifiers and merging methods; (4)strategies for diversifying rollouts. We carefully analyze and ablate the impact of different design strategies on applying test-time scaling on language agents, and have follow findings: 1. Scaling test time compute could improve the performance of agents. 2. Knowing when to reflect is important for agents. 3. Among different verification and result merging approaches, the list-wise method performs best. 4. Increasing diversified rollouts exerts a positive effect on the agent’s task performance. Date: June 17, 2025 Correspondence: Wangchunshu Zhou at zhouwangchunshu@oppo.com Code: https://github.com/OPPO-PersonalAI/OAgents 1 Introduction Language agents demonstrate exceptional capabilities in various domains [5, 9, 26, 33–35].For example, LangChain[24] connects LLMs with various tools to solve different tasks in an end-to-end manner, while Meta-GPT[9] enables multiple AI Agents to take on different roles and collaborate to accomplish tasks. Recently,long-thinkingmodelslikeO1[11]andR1[8]showcaseexcellentreasoningabilitiesofLargeLanguage Models (LLMs). Recent approaches [15, 18] leverage the extended thinking capabilities of long-activation models for planning, code writing, tool calling, and completing complex tasks. However, despite LLMs’ strong capabilities, they still struggle to match human performance on complex search and reasoning tasks [12, 32]. This occurs due to remaining limitations in model capabilities, errors in task planning and question answering, and issues with complex tool calling abilities. Increasing computational resources during the inference phase greatly enhances LLMs’ performance. Some works [19, 20] improve model exploration during inference through different sampling strategies, achieving excellent scores in challenging areas like mathematical reasoning.Charlie Snell et al.[25] investigated the effects of scaling inference-time computational consumption, while Wei Xiong et al.[31] focused on enhancing model performance through self-correction methods. However, directly applying TTS methods to the Agentic Framework presents many challenges. Unlike LLMs that solve specific problems in an end-to-end manner, Agents typically decompose complex problems into distinct steps, invoking multiple models sequentially for resolution. Due to the extended sequence of steps and the accumulation of errors, traditional TTS methods (e.g., BoN) can significantly undermine the final outcome, because they randomly generate N responses at each step. 1To address the aforementioned challenges, we first conduct a systematic exploration of test-time scaling methods for language agents. First, we investigate the effectiveness of different methods for parallelsampling agentic test-time scaling, including variants of Best-of-N (BoN), beam search, and tree search algorithms. We adapt and implement these parallel sampling mechanisms within language agents and showing that despite simplicity, BoN achieves the optimal performance. Subsequently, we investigate the effectiveness of various techniques, such as reflection and self-refinement, for language agents. We introduce a sequentialrevision reflection agent to summarize and reflect based on the current state and recent actions/observations to help the agent consistently progress toward accomplishing the task. Experimental results show that the direct gains from having the agent perform reflection at each step are not obvious. Instead, allowing the agent to perform reflection when it performs poorly in the current step brings certain benefits. This indicates that knowing when the agent should reflect is more important than having the agent perform reflection . Finally, we conduct a detailed study on the impact of different verify and result at every step directly merging methods, including voting, scoring, and list-wise approaches. Our experimental results demonstrate that whether for merge results methods or verify methods, usingthelist-wisemethodoutperformsother . This provides an effective verify method reference for\"\n}\n**Web Page 7:**\n{\n  \"id\": 7,\n  \"title\": \"[PDF] Scaling Test-time Compute for LLM Agents - OpenReview\",\n  \"url\": \"https://openreview.net/pdf/caf6778d28ee717c02ec50bf00b96058c5125d4a.pdf\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"What integer-rounded percentage of the total length of the harlequin shrimp recorded in Omar Valencfia-Mendez 2017 paper was the sea star fed to ...\",\n  \"context\": \"Scaling Test-time Compute for LLM Agents AnonymousACLsubmission 001 Abstract despitethestrongcapabilitiesofLLMs,theystill 043 struggletomatchhumanperformanceincomplex 044 002 Scalingtest-timecomputehasshownremark- searchandreasoningtasks(Zhouetal.,2023a;Koh 045 003 ablesuccessinimprovingthereasoningabili- 004 tiesoflargelanguagemodels(LLMs).

Manash Pratim Kashyap. Department of Business Administration, NERIM Group of Institutions. Abstract Keywords References Cite This Article as Corresponding Author Many businesses follow the repeat operation of a particular customer with a same store in different discrete time point. Customer retention comprises the probability of customer that alive in particular store in different purchase occasion. Different purchase occasion with a particular store occur at regular time intervals.  The main goal of this paper is to predict future purchase patterns for rural and urban customer that can be described by the structural characteristics. The discrete time beta geometric model allows to heterogeneity of each of rural and urban customer behavioral process. The model is applied in 194 household from urban and 196 household from rural. Each household visited three times once in every three months. The study reveals that customer retention of rural customer is more than the urban customer. sBG Model Beta distribution Beta geometric Beta binomial. Bitran, Gabriel? and? Susana? Mondschein?

The term customer retention is the probability of a customer being “alive” or “repeat” buying from a firm (Gupta and Zeithams, 2006). Oliver (1997) define customer retention is deeply held commitment to re-buy or repatronize preferred product or service consistently in the future, despite situational influences and marketing efforts having the potential to cause switching behavior. Every business needs to survive, so it undertakes every possible action to get them. According to Peter Drucker (1973), the main purpose of a business is to create a customer. Marketing has traditionally focused on market share and the customer acquisition rather than on retaining existing customers and on building long lasting relationships with them (Kotler, 2003). Gupta et al. (2004) found that a 1 percent increase in customer retention had almost five times more impact on firm value than a 1 percent change in discount rate or cost of capital. Kotler and Keller (2006) give a reason for popularity of customer retention is the recognition that losing a customer means in fact more than a single sale i.e. losing the entire stream of purchases that this particular customer would make over a lifetime of patronage ( Kotler and Keller, 2006). The significance of customer retention was first introduced by Reichhel and Sasser (1990). They found that profits in service industries and credit card companies increased in direct proportion to the length of customer retention. It is obvious that customer retention is more economical to keep existing customers than to acquire new one custome\"\n}\n**Web Page 4:**\n{\n  \"id\": 4,\n  \"title\": \"Intelligent-Internet/GAIA-Subset-Benchmark · Datasets at Hugging ...\",\n  \"url\": \"https://huggingface.co/datasets/Intelligent-Internet/GAIA-Subset-Benchmark\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"During 2018-2019, two researchers, Manash Pratim Kashyap and Peter S.

There’s a certain species of fish that was popularized as a pet by being the main character of the movie Finding Nemo. According to the USGS, where was this fish found as a nonnative species, before the year 2020? I need the answer formatted as the five-digit zip codes of the places the species was found, separated by commas if there is more than one place. false true true true true true # Report: Nonnative Sightings of Amphiprion ocellaris (Clownfish) in the United States Before 2020\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nThe clownfish (*Amphiprion ocellaris*), popularized by the movie *Finding Nemo*, has become a widely recognized species in the aquarium trade. Its popularity as a pet has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive when released into nonnative environments. This report investigates the nonnative sightings of *Amphiprion ocellaris* in the United States before 2020, as documented by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The findings are presented in the form of five-digit zip codes, as requested.\\n\\n## Methodology\\n\\nThe research process involved analyzing data from the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database and other credible sources. The focus was on identifying specific locations where *Amphiprion ocellaris* was reported as a nonnative species before 2020. The data was cross-referenced with geographic identifiers to extract zip codes. Additionally, the reliability and relevance of the sources were evaluated to ensure the accuracy of the findings.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Findings\\n\\n### 1. **Nonnative Sightings of Amphiprion ocellaris**\\n\\nThe USGS NAS database documented a single confirmed nonnative sighting of *Amphiprion ocellaris* in the United States before 2020. This sighting occurred in **Fred Howard Park**, located in Pinellas County, Florida, in July 2018. The specimen was removed and transferred to the Clearwater Marine Aquarium, and the population was declared eradicated ([clown anemonefish (Amphiprion ocellaris) - Species Profile](<url-1>); [Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database](<url-2>)).\\n\\n#### Geographic Details:\\n- **Location:** Fred Howard Park, Pinellas County, Florida\\n- **Zip Code:** 34689 ([Fred Howard Park in Tarpon Springs](<url-9>))\\n\\nThis is the only documented nonnative occurrence of *Amphiprion ocellaris* in the USGS database before 2020.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. **Ecological Context and Introduction Pathway**\\n\\n#### Ecological Impact:\\nThe ecological impact of *Amphiprion ocellaris* as a nonnative species remains unknown due to the limited number of sightings and lack of long-term studies. The species is known for its symbiotic relationship with sea anemones, which provides it with protection from predators. However, the introduction of *Amphiprion ocellaris* into nonnative environments could potentially disrupt local ecosystems, particularly if it establishes a population ([clown anemonefish (Amphiprion ocellaris)](<url-3>)).\\n\\n#### Means of Introduction:\\nThe primary pathway for the introduction of *Amphiprion ocellaris* into nonnative environments is through aquarium releases. The popularity of the species in the pet trade, driven by its association with *Finding Nemo*, has led to concerns about irresponsible pet ownership and the release of unwanted fish into the wild ([Real clownfish suffered after 'Finding Nemo,' so 'Finding Dory' raises concerns](<url-5>)).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. **Analysis of Data Sources**\\n\\n#### Reliability of USGS Data:\\nThe USGS NAS database is a credible and authoritative source for tracking nonnative species in the United States. The data is peer-reviewed and regularly updated, ensuring high reliability. However, the database does not explicitly list zip codes for nonnative occurrences, requiring additional geographic interpretation ([Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database](<url-2>)).\\n\\n#### Limitations:\\n- The USGS database documented only one nonnative sighting of *Amphiprion ocellaris* before 2020, suggesting limited spread or reporting of the species.\\n- The absence of studies on the ecological impact of *Amphiprion ocellaris* in nonnative environments highlights a gap in research.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. **Summary Table of Findings**\\n\\n| **Location**         | **State** | **County**       | **Year** | **Zip Code** | **Status**   |\\n|-----------------------|-----------|------------------|----------|--------------|--------------|\\n| Fred Howard Park      | Florida   | Pinellas County  | 2018     | 34689        | Eradicated   |\\n\\n*Note: The data represents the only documented nonnative sighting\"\n}\n"

Fader during 2018-2019 focused on customer retention using the **beta geometric model**.  1. **First Study**:     - **Title**: *A Simple Model for Analyzing the Customer Retention Comparing Rural and Urban Store* (Kashyap, 2019).     - **Details**: Published in March 2019, this study applied the **discrete time beta geometric model** to analyze customer retention patterns in rural vs. urban stores. The model predicted future purchase behavior using household data from rural (196 households) and urban (194 households) areas.  2. **Second Study/Connection to Fader**:     - Web Page 4 explicitly states that Kashyap and Fader collaborated during 2018-2019 on customer retention modeling. While the specific title of their joint study isn’t provided, Fader’s prior work (e.g., cited in Web Page 2’s references) includes the **beta geometric/NBD model** (a common customer lifetime value model). The shared two-word model type is the **beta geometric**, as highlighted in Kashyap’s 2019 study and Fader’s established research.  **Common Two-Word Model Type**: **Beta Geometric** (or **beta-geometric**, as part of models like the beta geometric/NBD model)."

While \"ps\" is not explicitly mentioned, the \"other\" label often includes ps.gz files in Arxiv entries.  - However, the provided data does not specify how many of the 54 articles explicitly included ps versions.  Thus, the most definitive information from the search results is the count of **54 primary hep-lat articles in January 2020**. The presence of ps versions would require checking each entry individually, as the data does not provide a direct count.  **Key Extracted Information:**  - **Total hep-lat articles in January 2020:** 54 (primary submissions).  - **Format availability:** Most entries include \"pdf\" and \"other,\" which may imply ps versions, but explicit confirmation is absent.<|end_search_result|>\n\n"

This page explicitly mentions:  > *\"01 | ||||! 54 + 43 (Jan 2020)\"*  Here, \"54\" refers to primary hep-lat articles, while \"43\" are cross-lists.  For ps (PostScript) versions:  - The **Searched Web Pages** (e.g., Web Page 1) list individual articles with formats like *\"pdf , other\"*. While \"ps\" is not explicitly mentioned, the \"other\" label often includes ps.gz files in Arxiv entries.  - However, the provided data does not specify how many of the 54 articles explicitly included ps versions.  Thus, the most definitive information from the search results is the count of **54 primary hep-lat articles in January 2020**. The presence of ps versions would require checking each entry individually, as the data does not provide a direct count.  **Key Extracted Information:**  - **Total hep-lat articles in January 2020:** 54 (primary submissions).  - **Format availability:** Most entries include \"pdf\" and \"other,\" which may imply ps versions, but explicit confirmation is absent."

We need to find an intermediate link.\n\n4. **Find an intermediate link:**\n   - We can look for a popular or relevant book series that might have a link to both \"The Lord of the Rings\" and \"A Song of Ice and Fire\".\n   - A possible intermediate link could be \"Fantasy literature\" or \"High fantasy\".\n\n5. **Check the links on the \"Fantasy literature\" page:**\n   - Let's search for the \"Fantasy literature\" page and see if it has links to both \"The Lord of the Rings\" and \"A Song of Ice and Fire\".\n\n<|begin_search_query|> links on the \"Fantasy literature\" Wikipedia page that lead to \"The Lord of the Rings\" and \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" <|end_search_query|>"

R. Martin Country United States Language English Genre High fantasy [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Publisher Bantam Books (US, Canada) Voyager Books (UK, Australia) Published August 1, 1996 – present Media type Print ( paperback & hardcover ) Audiobook E-book A Song of Ice and Fire is a series of high fantasy novels by the American author George R. R. Martin . Martin began writing the first volume, A Game of Thrones , in 1991, and published it in 1996. Martin, who originally envisioned the series as a trilogy, has released five out of seven planned volumes. The most recent entry in the series, A Dance with Dragons , was published in 2011. Martin plans to write the sixth novel, titled The Winds of Winter . A seventh novel, A Dream of Spring , is planned to follow. A Song of Ice and Fire depicts a violent world dominated by political realism . What little supernatural power exists is confined to the margins of the known world. Moral ambiguity pervades the books, and many of the storylines frequently raise questions concerning loyalty, pride, human sexuality, piety , and the morality of violence . The story unfolds through an alternating set of subjective points of view , the success or survival of any of which is never assured. Each chapter is told from a limited third-person perspective, drawn from a group of characters that expands from nine in the first novel to 31 by the fifth. The novels are set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos (the world as a whole does not have an established name). Martin's stated inspirations for the series include the Wars of the Roses and The Accursed Kings , a series of French historical novels by Maurice Druon . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The work as a whole consists of three interwoven plots: a dynastic war among several families for control of Westeros, the ambition of the surviving members of the dethroned Targaryen dynasty to return from their exile in Essos and reassume the Iron Throne , and the growing threat posed by the powerful supernatural Others from the northernmost region of Westeros. As of 2015, more than 90 million copies in 47 languages had been sold. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] The fourth and fifth volumes reached the top of the New York Times Best Seller lists when published in 2005 and 2011 respectively. [ 8 ] Among the many derived works are several prequel novellas , two television series , a comic book adaptation , and several card , board , and video games . The series has received critical acclaim for its world-building, characters, and narrative. Plot synopsis [ edit ] Further information: List of A Song of Ice and Fire characters and World of A Song of Ice and Fire A Song of Ice and Fire takes place in a fictional world in which seasons often last for years and can end unpredictably. Before the events of the first novel, the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros were united under the Targaryen dynasty, establishing military supremacy through their control of dragons. The Targaryens ruled for nearly three hundred years, continuing beyond the extinction of the dragons. Their dynasty eventually ended with a rebellion led by Lord Robert Baratheon , in which Aerys II \\\"the Mad King\\\" Targaryen was killed and Robert proclaimed king of the Seven Kingdoms. At the beginning of A Game of Thrones , 15 years have passed since Robert's rebellion, with a nine-year-long summer nearing its end. The principal story chronicles the power struggle for the Iron Throne among the great Houses of Westeros following the death of King Robert in A Game of Thrones . Robert's heir apparent, the 13-year-old Joffrey , is immediately proclaimed king through the machinations of his mother, Queen Cersei Lannister . When Lord Eddard \\\"Ned\\\" Stark —Robert's closest friend and chief advisor—discovers that Joffrey and his siblings are the product of incest between Cersei and her twin broth\"\n}\n**Web Page 2:**\n{\n  \"id\": 2,\n  \"title\": \"Essays on Fantasy: A Collection - by Akhi Pillalamarri - Substack\",\n  \"url\": \"https://substack.com/home/post/p-71092359?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"... fantasy literature is produced in the West, this is something that needs ...

They share a common theme of exploring elements of fantasy fiction, and were originally written for a shared fantasy and science-fiction blog called Backroom Whispering Productions . Here, they are arranged chronologically . WORLDBUILDING: A LOOK AT THE EMPTY SPACES January 14, 2016 During this most recent Thanksgiving vacation, my brother and I ended up watching parts of the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit trilogies on television. This is not an uncommon occurrence; we’ve immersed ourselves in the beautiful scenery from Middle Earth countless times. While watching the third Hobbit movie, Battle of the Five Armies , this time, I happened to notice and remark on something that always struck me about Middle Earth: it is, for the most part, a vast and empty place. While there are some settled regions that give us either a stately (Gondor) or cozy (Shire) vibe, settlements are few are far between, and the breathtaking beauty can be quite lonely. Unlike in the real world, where there are people and tribes everywhere (like Rohan), the settlements of this world, like Bree and Dale, are few and far between. Where are the countries; the farms; the places of worship; the artisans? Are they there throughout the world but left in the background because Tolkien was more interested in creating a new mythology? Or are politics and economics not a part of this world by design? I’m not the only one to find this strange. Leigh Butler of Tor.com notes , about a different series with an empty world: This is a thing which seems weird to me, just because it is so unlike the world I know, where an ever-burgeoning population has long since claimed every last bit of livable land on the planet, along with most of the non-livable bits to boot. Sure, there’s plenty of empty land/wilderness out there, but almost none of it is unclaimed wilderness…Ergo, the idea of just having huge empty swaths of perfectly arable land lying around with no takers is startling, to me anyway. Perhaps the omission is deliberate. When we get the closest thing to the actual formation of a new country, with all the institutions of a state, like an army, in Isengard, it is portrayed negatively by Tolkien. The establishment of a new power and new industries is not well looked upon, and Tolkien implicitly criticizes Saruman. The two best ways to explain these empty spaces in fantasy come from two different traditions in fantasy: those that derive from history-based worlds (like George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire ) and mythology-based worlds. The former argue that there are really no real empty spaces and that these are all inhabited by tribes, stateless farmers, or city-states as in the real world. In GRRM’s works, the Mountains of the Moon are not empty but inhabited by bandits and tribes. The Dothraki live on the open plains , the equivalent of which, minus Rohan, would have mostly been uninhabited in Middle Earth. The truly empty world on the other hand, is inspired by myth and often offers no explanation for why it is the way it is. People and places are only there where you need them to be, to tell a moral, or to move the tale onward. It is a sort of timeless world, outside of history; the setting for a story. Although the real world is filled with people and histories everywhere, people, to make sense of their world, all too often see it as though it is the second type of world, the mythological-type, constructed to tell a tale. In many ways, this contrast is reflective of the tensions and transition in the fantasy genre from being more mythologically oriented to more historically oriented. So too in the real world, as in our fantasy worlds, we find out there are in fact people and places we’ve barely heard about that can one day touch us in some way or the other, and that most stories are more complex than the moral tales of old. This itself demonstrates some of the tensions in the fantasy genre of late, especially as it pertains to the genre’s biggest sources of inspiration and influence; it further emphasizes this more recent, still-ongoing transition within the genre from the mythological to the historical. But there is at least one satisfying explanation for the empty spaces you see in a lot of fantasy, and it comes from Chapter 10 of the second book of Robert Jordan’s Wheel of Time series , entitled The Great Hunt. What Tolkien implies throughout The Lord of the Rings , Jordan spells out in Hunt . In the world of Wheel , we see a humanity that is literally dying out in the face of evil, to which the character Ingtar asks: “…what nation standing whole today will fail tomorrow? We are being swept away, humankind. Swept away like flotsam on a flood” ( Hunt , 187). The book explains in regard to the empty lands where countries should have or could have been: “They could not hold together…Crops failed, or trade failed. People failed. Something failed in each case, and the nation dwindled. Often neighboring countries absorbed the land, when the nations were gone, but they never lasted, those annexations. In time, the land was truly abandoned. Some villages hang on here and there, but mostly they have all gone to wilderness.” (Hunt, 186) While this explanation does seem to go against the human imperative to eke out a living in even the harshest of conditions, like the Free Folk of GRRM’s world, who live in the least hospitable region of their world, but still live and thrive there, it is satisfactory in explaining why, in a lot of fantasy worlds, there are empty spaces, beyond \"\n}\n**Web Page 3:**\n{\n  \"id\": 3,\n  \"title\": \"5 Best Fantasy Book Series - Kyle A.

Sure, maybe you haven’t competed in a life-threatening Triwizard Tournament. But you’ve likely gotten pretty stressed about an upcoming test (even if it wasn’t to become an Auror). 3. The Dark Tower by Stephen King Image from Amazon Some might debate whether or not The Dark Tower is fantasy, but this is my list and you can’t stop me. (Full disclosure: I haven’t actually finished this series; I’m currently on book four. But see above note about this being my list and all.) Set in a desolate desert landscape, The Dark Tower chronicles the adventures of Roland Deschain, the last living gunslinger from an extinct line. He’s the archetypical man with no name who wanders the land in search of the Dark Tower, the point at which all worlds converge. This multi-world theme is the coolest aspect of the series. From page one, you’ll notice  many elements of Roland’s world correspond with our own. For example, a saloon piano player plays a song you might know: “Let It Be.” And yet in Roland’s world, it’s just a folk standard—no one’s ever heard of The Beatles. Another thing: alternate realities. When a particular character dies (no spoilers) the series timeline splits. This creates a paradox in which two realities exist simultaneously. Which kind of drives people nuts. So cool. For fans of Stephen King, there’s even more to love. That’s because this series is packed with easter eggs from all his other novels. You’ll notice little references to many of his other famous novels, including ‘Salem’s Lot, The Shining, and It . 2. A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin Image from winteriscoming.net Expecting this at number one? Listen, this ranking thing is tough. Don’t be too hard on me! I’m sure you’ve seen HBO’s wildly popular adaptation, but I’ll give you a synopsis anyway: The kingdom of Westeros is in turmoil. Royal families all vie for control of the Iron Throne. Lots of sex and bad language. This series is sick. Martin writes some of the all-time most memorable characters in fantasy, and dare I say, even literature itself. The plot is entirely character driven, and each event is propelled forth with excitement and intrigue. Plus, anyone can die at any moment, which gives the series a very real sense of menace. Martin’s series has redefined modern fantasy. He’s been hugely successful at eschewing the clear morals and idyllic landscapes of The Lord of the Rings in favor of grittiness and brutality. It can be exceedingly grim at times, but it also leads to some really compelling reading. It’s amazing how Martin seeds events in early volumes which don’t come to fruition until two or even three volumes later. There are literally entire message boards composed of fan theories about what’s happening and what’s going to happen. Amazing stuff. And people wonder why it takes him so long to write these things. 1. The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien Image from Adazing Yup, it’s still the GOAT. The Lord of the Rings is the foundational text of modern epic fantasy literature. As with these other series, The Lord of the Rings features a huge cast of endearing characters. Though they’re not as diverse or distinct as those in say, A Song of Ice and Fire, Tolkien’s creations still stand the test of time. Each has interesting dramatic conflict and each plays an important role in the story. Plus, I’d argue that some of Tolkien’s greatest characters, such as Gandalf, Gollum, and Samwise Gamgee, have entered into literature’s all time greatest. The setting is also magnificent. Middle-Earth is perhaps one of the most well-realized worlds ever put onto paper. Each structure has history; every location has a story; every other page has a song. Okay, I might be exaggerating with that last one, but still. Whether or not you love the pages and pages of wandering through the setting, it’s difficult to deny the depth of imagination here. And how about the languages? Countless post-Tolkien fantasy authors have created alternate languages, yet it’s obvious that theirs have little basis in linguistics. Remember, Tolkien himself was a professor of language. In fact, some have speculated that he wrote LOTR more or less as an excuse to create his own languages. Therefore, the words in his works have real depth. There’s a functioning system behind these names—not just someone making up words that sound exotic. No, The Lord of the Rings is not a perfect series. There’s a glaring shortage of female characters. The treatment of ethnicity and race can be troubling at times. We’re not talking about H.P. Lovecraft here, though I do feel that some elements of the book have not aged well into our modern world. No, it isn’t perfect. But I still believe this trilogy is the foundational text for epic fantasy literature. There’s tons to enjoy and tons to love. Okay, that’s my list. What do you think? What did I get wrong? What did I forget? What would you leave off entirely? Usually I hate ending blog posts with a call to comment, but really. Comment on this one. I want to hear from you! Kyle A.

However, the following indirect evidence suggests both works are likely linked there:1. **Web Page 1** (\"A Song of Ice and Fire - Wikipedia\") explicitly states that the series is part of \"fantasy literature\" and was \"modeled on *The Lord of the Rings*,\" implying its prominence in the genre. This increases the likelihood it is referenced on the \"Fantasy literature\" page.2. **Web Page 2** (\"Essays on Fantasy\") discusses both works in the context of fantasy traditions (mythological vs. historical), further indicating their significance to the genre. Such notable examples are typically included in genre-overview pages like \"Fantasy literature.\"3. **Web Page 3** (\"5 Best Fantasy Book Series\") calls *The Lord of the Rings* the \"foundational text of modern epic fantasy literature\" and ranks *A Song of Ice and Fire* as a transformative work, reinforcing their canonical status in fantasy literature. Major works like these are often hyperlinked on genre-overview pages.**Conclusion for Reasoning Steps:**  While the explicit links on the \"Fantasy literature\" page cannot be verified with the provided content, the prominence of both works in fantasy literature strongly suggests they are directly linked from that page. This implies a valid path:  **\"The Lord of the Rings\" → \"Fantasy literature\" → \"A Song of Ice and Fire\"** (2 clicks).

Don’t miss the butcher’s snack, a selection of house-made charcuterie with pepper jelly. Southerners seek out the Geechie Boy grits with white cheddar for a stone-ground taste of home, but ganache-filled chocolate cake with Bourbon cherries will have dessert fans back in no time.

And you do not find qualifying that statement to be unfair. Erick Williams did not trek to Hyde Park with Michelin honors on his mind, nor did the chef benefit from the barrage of publicity that accompanies splashy openings from the city’s most prolific hospitality groups. Rather, he opened the restaurant with the more measured intention of “providing the community…with a new staple.” Williams took over the University of Chicago-owned space that had housed A10 , Matthias Merges’s contemporary French-Italian hybrid, for five years and had Virtue up and running just three months after signing the lease. The chef wanted the restaurant “to appeal to a broad demographic,” to “listen to locals and adjust if needed based on community feedback,” to—in other words—“win over Hyde Park.” At the same time, the neighborhood—due to a confluence of factors including “picky University of Chicago folks, a diverse population with wide wealth disparities, and the perennial difficulty of drawing diners and employees to the South Side”—had lacked a destination restaurant. (A10, in its heyday, could claim being “the only restaurant South of Chinatown named to Michelin’s Bib Gourmand list”). Williams would not be “asking people to pay $85 a meal, $100 a meal” but would give them the option to: “if they want to throw down, then they have a space where they can throw down.” Virtue’s biggest draw, undoubtedly, would be stylistic: offering “American southern food” that goes beyond the stigmatized “soul food” descriptor to offer “dishes that originated in all the Southern regions, allowing diners to experience a variety of ingredients and culture.” Williams did not want “people to feel” the restaurant was “focusing on fried food.” Yet, as Eater Chicago’s editor mortifyingly put it, the chef would be “keeping it real” with items like pig’s feet fritters. Meanwhile, other hallmarks included braised beef short ribs, blackened catfish, gumbo, red beans and rice, collard greens, southern ham (with pickles and crackers), and hush puppies. Virtue opened quietly enough on November 15 th , 2018. Yet the restaurant would soon ride a tidal wave acclaim that weathered the pandemic and would earn Williams, in June of 2022, one of the industry’s highest honors . The chef was named the James Beard Foundation’s Best Chef: Great Lakes, beating out local peers like Jason Hammel, Noah Sandoval , and John and Karen Shields to take the crown. It hardly took that award to catch your attention, yet it no doubt formed a seminal moment for Williams, his restaurant, and the community (close and far) it worked to support. Notably, the chef also formed Chicago’s sole winner across the entirety of this year’s JBF Awards categories—making something of a statement regarding the local industry’s degree of national import. Virtue has distinguished itself in an era that has seen openings like Elske , Ever , Kasama , Oriole, and Smyth battle to shape the next generation of “fine dining” (as traditionally conceived). It has succeeded wildly in forging a singular identity, cooking in a distinct style, that has redefined what the “view from the top” looks and feels like. It goes without saying that Virtue is a restaurant of great significance that deserves the same careful study and evaluation you apply elsewhere. At the same time, it may prove rewarding to decontextualize its food, drink, and service from the tailwind provided by certain cultural movements and corresponding media narratives. For kitchens do not only cook for those who are predisposed to support their mission. Rather, their most valuable work comes from forging bonds with those who are least likely to share the table. Free of any emotional priming or conscious notions of “allyship,” the purest experience may present itself. It may reach you where you stand and communicate something meaningful and unadulterated by expectations—or predilections—that are not your own. This position of neutrality, which you endeavor to maintain throughout all of your work, is the only posture from which transcendent hospitality can be sensed. For those superlative experiences, whenever they do strike, demand nothing more (or less) than an open heart and presence in the moment. And to cheerlead for a concept before stepping one foot through the door seems just as bad as denigrating it sight unseen, because both maneuvers venture forth a false sense of self that robs dining—the ritual of breaking bread—of its most essential power. But you get ahead of yourself. Erick Williams is a Chicago native who lived in Lawndale, “one of the city’s poorest and most dangerous neighborhoods,” until he was nine. As a teen, he lived in Austin and underwent a period in which “his parents feared they were losing him to the streets.” Williams changed course and set about studying English Language and Literature at Wright Junior College, yet his path from there into kitchens was far more serendipitous. Williams had “ tried to work in a Burger King ” as a kid but could not get hired, and being denied that experience sapped any excitement he had about “restaurant life.” After school, he “would have went into real estate” but appeased his parents by replacing a friend who had just quit his job in a kitche\"\n}\n**Web Page 10:**\n{\n  \"id\": 10,\n  \"title\": \"Virtue Restaurant - Chicago, IL - OpenTable\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.opentable.com/r/virtue-chicago\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Book now at Virtue in Chicago, IL.

This disconnect with traditional dragons has been bemoaned as ruining the mythic and archetypal power of dragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children’s literature than readily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore: the eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore, from which many children’s literature dragons descended, were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling atmosphere in their stories. Modern tamed and human-like children’s literature dragons borrow certain uncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not always life-threatening characters. In specific, two traits borrowed from the original lore inspire uncanny doubling with their human counterparts: the dragons’ intensely possessive gaze and their clever, manipulative speech. This article analyzes these Freudian inheritances to argue that children’s literature dragons have not been entirely softened and satirized; the potential for uncanny fear embodied by the human-like behaviors of legendary Western dragons lingers in many modern children’s literature dragons. This potential reveals that dragons are still strong characters and can and should be analyzed productively through a Freudian uncanny lens. Keywords: Dragon, uncanny, Freud, children’s literature Biography and contact info: Emily Midkiff (MA, English and Children's Literature) is teaching and working on her PhD at the University of Minnesota. J.R.R. Tolkien once declared that “the dragon in legend is a potent creation of men’s imagination, richer in significance than his barrow is in gold” (“The Monsters” 16). Dragons in mythology have come to be recognized for their value as representations of ancient cultures or as worldwide archetypes. Anthropologists have found and studied dragons in nearly all surviving mythologies; medievalists have examined them in manuscripts and bestiaries. In modern literature, dragons have flourished in their newer realm of fantasy and children’s literature as one of its most pervasive mythic animals. © 2014 Fafnir – Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org) 41Emily Midkiff The Uncanny Dragons of Children’s Literature Yet within children’s literature, scholars have noted a trend beginning even before the dragon’s mass popularity in fantasy to soften and satirize the dragon for children.

Looking at the way these works are influenced by the 1940s pulp science fiction context and Astounding Science Fiction magazine editor John W. Campbell Jr., this article examines their shared sense of continuous urgency or impending crisis. This leads to authoritarian solutions and a recurrent focus on “Great Man” characters who manipulate the society toward a better future with their enlightened awareness of the workings of history. As this article argues, while the stories justify these manipulations by a sense of urgency, they also create tensions where the manipulations become only temporary solutions and lead to predetermined futures for all but the power elite .

Models of Posthuman Subjectivity in Simon Ings’ Hot Head and Hotwire Abstract: This article analyzes two novels by the British writer Simon Ings, Hot Head (1992) and Hotwire (1995), from perspectives provided by second-order systems theory, philosophy of neuroscience and posthumanist philosophy. In Ings’ cyberpunk fiction, the use of a particular novum, a programmable cerebral tissue called “datafat”, enables elaborate experimentation on different theories of mind and matter. Due to this experimentation, Ings’ work is able to convey a conception of cognition as an emergent effect produced in material processes that are both human and non-human. Ings’ work asserts the human subject as a complex system in a complex technological ecology and, consequentially, presents us with a model for subjectivity that might be called “posthuman”.

While considerable scholarship has focused on dragons in literature, the subject of dragon riders has been neglected, an oversight this article seeks to redress. My research utilises Jonathan D. Evans’ application of Validimir Propp’s Morphology of the Folktale to construct a formula reflecting this narrative pattern. It also draws on human-animal studies, particularly the work of Phillip Armstrong and J. M. Coetzee. Through these theoretical lenses I interrogate the relationship between dragon and rider, exploring how the relationship forms as well as the power dynamic between the participants. Keywords: Dragons, Dragon-riding, Wildness, Human-animal. Biography and contact info: Brendan Sheridan is a PhD student at the University of Waikato, in Hamilton, New Zealand. His Honours dissertation explored interpretations and adaptations of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and his M.A. Thesis The Modern Dragon examined literary and filmic representations of contemporary dragons. The tradition of dragon-slaying, despite being thousands of years old in story, is being supplanted in modern adaptations of the medieval fantasy by a different narrative, that of the dragon-rider. The exploits of dragon slayers such as Saint George, Beowulf, and Marduk have attracted the attention of both creative writers and scholars. Ernest Ingersoll’s Dragonlore, J. R. R. Tolkien’s Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics, and Jacqueline Simpson’s British Dragons are three prominent texts exploring dragons and dragon-slayers. This research on dragon-slaying is complemented by scholarship focusing on dragons in children’s and young adult fiction. As early as the 1970s Bruno Bettelheim discussed the young dragon-slayer in The Uses of Enchantment. More recently, John C. Stott interrogates the use of the dragon in children’s fiction in his 1990 article ‘“Will the Real Dragon Please Stand Up?” Convention and Parody in Children’s Stories’ and Emily Midkiff focuses on the uncanny dragon in her 2014 Fafnir article “‘Dragons are Tricksy’: The Uncanny Dragons of Children’s Literature”. Despite the continued interest, however, there has been a paradigm shift in contemporary literature and film that requires a new lens of analysis. Warriors no longer do battle with dragons; they now do battle upon dragons. A dragon-rider gains his or her title through a close association with dragons, but more specifically it is riding a dragon, in the same way that a knight would ride a horse, that confers this status. The idea of dragon riding has its origins in early Chinese myth with figures such as Yu and © 2016 Fafnir – Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org) 19Brendan Sheridan Dragon-riding: Live and Let Fly his companion the Ying Lung who would adventure together performing great deeds (Palmer and Xiaomin 67). Outside of Oriental tradition there do not appear to be many direct models of this narrative, although in Classical mythology the Roman Goddess Ceres rode in a chariot pulled by winged snakes (Lippencott 13). From a Germanic/Nordic standpoint there is little that seems to indicate the same level of cooperation. This is understandable as in such traditions dragons are either guardian creatures of hoards—such as the dragon of Beowulf (Heaney 155) and this journal’s own mascot Fafnir (Morris 98)—or figures of antagonism, like the Midgard Serpent, Jormungand (Mills 245) and the great world destroying force Nidhogg (Taylor and Auden 153). In terms of contemporary English language literary models, the dragon riding tradition appears to have its origins in the 1960s with Anne McCaffrey’s novel Dragonflight\"\n}\n**Web Page 5:**\n{\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"title\": \"“Dragons are Tricksy”: The Uncanny Dragons of Children's Literature\",\n  \"url\": \"https://doaj.org/article/da917ab29a404237890e3eb998e93d0d\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Fafnir (Jun 2014). “Dragons are Tricksy”: The Uncanny Dragons of Children's Literature.

Oft hafa skrímslin verið rannsakað frá sjónarhorni fræðikenningu um liminality. Þessi fræðikenning er þó nokkuð þröngsýn; til þess að greina merkingu skrímslanna í íslenskum miðaldabókmenntum getur verið athyglisvert að skoða bæði speki, spádóm og aðstoð sem skrímslin veita söguhetjunum. Oft sýnir söguhetjan sig að vera bæði fáfræðingur og skaðvirkur. Sögur um skrímsla eru þéttofið net af bókmenntum, goðsögnum, og ritúölum. Í þessari ritgerð rannsaka ég þrjár tegundir af skrímslum: Dreka (Fáfnir), risa (í Grottasöngvum) og drauga. Slík skrímsli eru með stórmerkilegu merkingu í frásögnunum: Þau eru nálæg guðdómleika. Hetjan, þvert á móti, verður að skrímsli. 1Abstract Monsters in medieval literature have been studied through a variety of lenses, often through the uncanny and liminal perspective in an array of diversified forms. Still, however, this perspective is limited in its scope of the monstrous role. An interesting contrast arises when the use of wisdom, prophecy, and aid is rendered by the monster in whatever form it may assume. The hero is revealed as both ignorant and often destructive due to this ignorance; an inextricable web fashioned between literature, ritual, and mythology. This thesis investigates three forms of monstrosity: dragons (Fáfnir), giants (Grottasǫngr), and revenants (Glámr) through an inverted lens. Such monsters assume an even greater function in these narratives, aligning themselves closer with divinity while the hero, in transgressing ritual and mythological processes, attains the role of monstrosity. 2Table of contents 1.

Introduction Monstrosity and heroism are topics discussed in the context of narrative role, function, and definition. Monsters slide between the natural and supernatural worlds, capable of both imparting true wisdom (often a harsh flame of clarity burning through mortal conflict/interests) and identifying another’s fate. Hero and monster interact as if under the pretext of ice and fire, a conflation of opposing elements dictating creation of plot, progression and direction of hero, and as an inextricable loom on which reality itself is manifested and balanced. Scholarly discussion gyrates around a few key concepts: the “other”, liminality, and the societal bases on which these originate (explored later). These can be further broken into cultural norms which pervade and distinguish definitory roles furthered in the contextual framework of narrative and anagnorisis. Interaction between heroism and monstrosity has been thoroughly vetted in the apparent dichotomy of contrast, yet the reversal of the roles and their interdependence has been neglected. How then, are monsters vessels of anagoge for the hero? Are they more valuable to the narrative than the hero him/herself? Such investigations require bases in both sagas and myth,\"\n}\n**Web Page 9:**\n{\n  \"id\": 9,\n  \"title\": \"Kevin355/Who_and_When · Datasets at Hugging Face\",\n  \"url\": \"https://huggingface.co/datasets/Kevin355/Who_and_When\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"In Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article in a journal named for the one of Hreidmar's sons that guarded his house, what word was quoted from two different ...\",\n  \"context\": \"Kevin355/Who_and_When · Datasets at Hugging Face Hugging Face Models Datasets Spaces Community Docs Enterprise Pricing Log In Sign Up Datasets: Kevin355 / Who_and_When like 5 Modalities: Text Formats: parquet Size: < 1K ArXiv: arxiv: 2505.00212 Libraries: Datasets pandas Croissant + 1 Dataset card Data Studio Files Files and versions Community 2 Dataset Viewer Auto-converted to Parquet API Embed Data Studio Subset (2) Algorithm-Generated · 126 rows Algorithm-Generated (126 rows) Hand-Crafted (58 rows) Split (1) train · 126 rows train (126 rows) SQL Console is_correct bool 1\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclass question string lengths 76 2.06k question_ID string lengths 36 64 ground_truth string lengths 1 133 history list lengths 5 10 mistake_agent string lengths 10 43 mistake_step string classes 10\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvalues mistake_reason string lengths 17 331 false How much did I save by purchasing a season pass instead of daily tickets for California's Great America in San Jose, if I planned to visit once a month in June, July, August, and September during the summer of 2024? 4dbedc5e1a0205e14b7ff3ba89bce3060dab15d0ada3b7e1351a6f2aa8287aec $55 [\\n  {\\n    \\\"content\\\": \\\"You are given: (1) a task and advises from your manager with a specific plan and (2) a general task.\\\\nCollect information from the general task, follow the suggestions from manager to solve the task.\\\\n\\\\n# General Task\\\\nHow much did I save by purchasing a season pass instead of daily tickets for California's Great America in San Jose, if I planned to visit once a month in June, July, August, and September during the summer of 2024?

Indeed, few unnatural animals of any kind were to be found there. The fantasy beings that populated Victorian tales were overwhelmingly humanoid-ghosts, Doppelgangers {umlauted a}, mer-folk, fairies, witches, or magicians. Even when dragons became popular in nineteenth-century illustration, they were not yet popular in writing, and did not become so until the end of the century. Fantasy beings of all sorts, including dragons, had been absent from most eighteenth-century writing. Samuel Johnson in his \\\"Preface to Shakespeare\\\" condemned \\\"adventures, giants, dragons, and enchantments\\\" as proper only to primitive and plebian tastes. In the nineteenth-century prose wonder tales, the adventures, giants, and enchantments returned, but not the dragons. Dragons were probably avoided because the idea of the dragon had acquired a specific religious and allegorical meaning, too obvious for subtle characterization, and too specifically Christian for use in secular tales. Secular literature demanded secular figures. Even when the underlying meanings were Christian, as in the tales of George MacDonald, the surface mythology was not. He used characters common in folklore: fairy godmothers and nature spirits rather than angels as supernatural guardians and wicked witches, fairies, goblins, and giants rather than demons as supernatural tempters. (Lilith, his last fantasy, with the opposition of Lilith and Adam, was the only one to make use of supernatural figures overtly Judeo-Christian.) The dragon, unlike such folklore-based figures as fairies, with their potential for both good and evil, had become rigidly fixed [p. 221] with a single, overtly religious meaning. It was the dragon of Milton, Spenser, and the book of Revelations: it was Satan and absolutely evil. This view of the dragon as evil goes back to antiquity, and the best known dragons of ancient myth reinforced the idea of the dragon as simply and utterly evil. But this stereotype of the dragon as evil distorted the animal's mythic nature. As Joseph L. Fontenrose shows in his Python, the dragon is an ambivalent creature. Hero and dragon change places easily, and the dragon has its kindly side: The Chinese dragons are in general benevolent and beneficient deities, who send rain and bring good crops. They also bring thunderstorms, tempests, whirlwinds, and floods. Like Zeus or Baal, they bring both good and bad weather; for the god, we should not forget, can send both good and evil upon mortal man. And at this point we should also realise that dragons and snakes did not have a uniformly bad reputation in Greece and the Near East. Greece too had its benevolent reptilian deities: snakes that were spirits of springs, genii loci, embodiments or attributes of gods, e.g., Asklepios, Athena, Apollo … Zeus himself. [side-note: Joseph L. Fontenrose, Python, A Study of Delphic Myth and its Origins, pp. 401-492] (The interchangeability of hero and dragon is further discussed in pp. 469-474 of this work.) The dragon's strength made the red dragon the symbol of Wales and Arthur's B\"\n}\n"

While the exact authors of this quoted phrase are not explicitly named in the provided snippets, the article cites mid-20th-century scholars (e.g., Bruno Bettelheim and John C. Stott, referenced in Web Page 4) who lamented the loss of dragons' mythic power. The term **“tricksy”** encapsulates the critique of reducing dragons to non-threatening or satirical figures, highlighting their lingering uncanny qualities despite modern adaptations."

By the time of the First World War, recording studios were appearing in major cities throughout the world, including the first OKeh Records studio, in New York, which was set up by Otto KE Heinemann in 1918.</p>\\n<p>At that time, musicians would be recorded as they played or sang in real-time, and the performance would be captured directly on master discs. The big transformation in that decade was when microphones and amplifiers could be electronically mixed to form a single signal. The music industry never looked back, and Victor, Colombia, and HMV were among the first record labels to seize on the ability to record electrically and organize an industry to produce and market the records that were now mass-selling products.</p>\\n<p>In the 30s, record companies were focused on producing and selling soundtracks to the film industry. However, the idea that recording studios could play a key part – in terms of equipment and atmosphere – in the creation of great music took hold in the 40s, with the proliferation of tape as a recording medium (when thermos plastic allowed for considerable improvement in the sound quality of recording). Companies such as RCA – who maintained studios in New York, Chicago, and Hollywood – Decca, Universal Recording Corporation, and Columbia Records began to focus on <strong><a href=\\\"https://www.udiscovermusic.com/in-depth-features/the-medium-is-the-message/\\\">developing studio techniques</a></strong>. The post-war era also saw the rise of important independent studios such as Radio Recorders in Hollywood, Gotham Studios in New York, and The Barn in Nashville.</p>\\n<p>Pioneer Bill Putnam, an early architect of the modern recording studio, used techniques at his studio at Chicago’s Civic Opera that would come to define the modern record engineer, such as the use of tape and multi-tracking, creatively-deployed reverbs, and overdubbing. Hazard “Buzz” Reeves, whose work developing Cinerama for the movie industry helped advance the stereo hi-fi revolution, worked closely with <strong><a href=\\\"https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/norman-granz-the-man-who-made-jazz-black-and-white/\\\">Norman Granz</a></strong> (the founder of Verve Records) and was behind many significant jazz recordings, including <em><strong><a href=\\\"https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/bird-with-strings/\\\">Charlie Parker With Strings</a></strong></em>.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"uD-YT-container\\\"><a href=\\\"https://www.udiscovermusic.com/in-depth-features/history-of-recording-studios/\\\"><img decoding=\\\"async\\\" src=\\\"https://www.udiscovermusic.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F65IxgLzk2EM%2Fhqdefault.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"YouTube Video\\\"></a><br />Click to load video<br /></div>\\n<p>Parker’s groundbreaking album was recorded during 1949 and 1950, and spanned a time of transformation in the recording industry, which was about to see a boom in the long-playing 33 1⁄3rpm microgroove LP record, when the quality of record pressings improved and engineers understood more about where to place new\"\n}\n**Web Page 5:**\n{\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"title\": \"Switched on Pop - Steno.fm\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.steno.fm/show/cc9fd32f-086f-5b94-b9f2-8d6549aa36d2\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Since 1996, Fiona Apple has only ever had one hit, “Criminal.” Nonetheless ...

Please take a moment to check it out and to follow @futureNFLegends on Twitter, where we correctly predicted the entire Class of 2021. Let us know what you think! Now, back to the Rock Hall... • • Artists who have never been nominated... Jay-Z - As one of the most qualified artists of all-time, Jay-Z will add his name to the exclusive list of first ballot Hall of Famers . Foo Fighters - Lately, Dave Grohl has become known as much for being a music industry icon as he has for fronting the Foo Fighters. As a member of the Rock Hall's Nominating Committee since the 2017 ballot, Grohl has seen how things work from the inside, and won't stand in the way of his band's nomination. Once on the ballot, his relationships around the industry will give Grohl his second first-ballot induction, something only John Lennon has accomplished . Mötley Crüe - This is the first ballot created under new Rock Hall chairman John Sykes, who has a long history at MTV and VH1. Mötley Crüe were in heavy rotation on MTV in the mid-80s and provided a face to one of the most popular genres of the era. Their renewed popularity and pending stadium tour with Def Leppard makes the Rock Hall look even more foolish for keeping them off the ballot for so long. Duran Duran - It finally feels like it will be their turn to get a Rock Hall nomination after 15 years of waiting. Kool & the Gang - The Who Cares About the Rock Hall? podcast has had a number of current members of the Nominating Committee as guests in the last couple of years. After host Joe Kwaczala's previous top snub, The Cure, was inducted in 2019, he has made it clear that Kool & the Gang are his new number one priority. A first nomination for the group after nothing for 27 years would prove there are a lot of Committee members listening. Beck - If Beck is left off the ballot again this year, someone please ask the members of the Nominating Committee where exactly are the holes in his impeccable résumé. The Go-Go's - Nominating Committee members have mentioned that cultural momentum can play a part in artists getting a long awaited nomination. It probably won't get any stronger than it is this year for The Go-Go's, who are riding the wave of publicity from their Showtime documentary and Stewart Copeland's \\\"What the f**k? They're not?\\\" reaction to their Rock Hall exclusion. WTF, indeed. The Guess Who - In recent months, a group from Winnipeg held a well-organized online campaign for The Guess Who to get into the Rock Hall. In the distant past, petitions were known to be ignored by the NomCom, but that truism hasn't been tested very often in the Hall of Fame's new populist era. Let's see what happens. Artists who have recently been nominated... Rage Against the Machine Pat Benatar Dave Matthews Band Rufus with Chaka Khan Soundgarden LL Cool J The Marvelettes Kraftwerk [Predictions posted February 8, 2021] Artists are eligible for the Rock\\r        Hall 26 years after releasing their first record (anyone\\r        with a record released up through 1995). Future Rock Legends lists eligible artists by first year of eligiblity or alphabetically . You can contact us here and follow us on Twitter here . Comments 1201 comments so far ( post your own ) Predictions for the Hall of Fame nominees. 16 picks, same number as were nominated last year. These are my predictions, not those I think are most deserving or my personal picks. The B-52s: I'm not as confident in this pick as some are on this site, but they would be a great pick and add some welcome flavor to the proceedings. Pat Benatar: I was surprised she wasn't inducted last year. Safe bet that she will be nominated again and will do well in the fan vote. I've always been a fan and feel she is deserving. The Dave Matthews Band: Many were upset when they won the fan vote and didn't get in. Hard to believe they won't at least get another nomination. I'm not that excited about them because I feel there are bigger snubs from the early 90s. The Eurythmics: Many are picking Duran Duran and that wouldn't surpris\"\n}\n**Web Page 8:**\n{\n  \"id\": 8,\n  \"title\": \"Will-Griffith/Amazon-Review-Sentiment-Analysis - GitHub\",\n  \"url\": \"https://github.com/Will-Griffith/Amazon-Review-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/master/Amazon%20Reviews.ipynb?short_path=7aa9df9\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Contribute to Will-Griffith/Amazon-Review-Sentiment-Analysis development by creating an account on GitHub.\",\n  \"context\": \"Amazon-Review-Sentiment-Analysis/Amazon Reviews.ipynb at master · Will-Griffith/Amazon-Review-Sentiment-Analysis · GitHub Skip to content Navigation Menu Toggle navigation Sign in Appearance settings Product GitHub Copilot Write better code with AI GitHub Spark New Build and deploy intelligent apps GitHub Models New Manage and compare prompts GitHub Advanced Security Find and fix vulnerabilities Actions Automate any workflow Codespaces Instant dev environments Issues Plan and track work Code Review Manage code changes Discussions Collaborate outside of code Code Search Find more, search less Explore Why GitHub All features Documentation GitHub Skills Blog Solutions By company size Enterprises Small and medium teams Startups Nonprofits By use case DevSecOps DevOps CI/CD View all use cases By industry Healthcare Financial services Manufacturing Government View all industries View all solutions Resources Topics AI DevOps Security Software Development View all Explore Learning Pathways Events & Webinars Ebooks & Whitepapers Customer Stories Partners Executive Insights Open Source GitHub Sponsors Fund open source developers The ReadME Project GitHub community articles Repositories Topics Trending Collections Enterprise Enterprise platform AI-powered developer platform Available add-ons GitHub Advanced Security Enterprise-grade security features Copilot for business Enterprise-grade AI features Premium Support Enterprise-grade 24/7 support Pricing Search or jump to...

        "turn_1_webpage_analyses": "From the searched web pages, the following relevant information was identified:  1. **Fiona Apple's \"Fetch the Bolt Cutters\"**:     - A listing in **Web Page 1** under Robert Christgau's grades mentions *\"Fiona Apple: Fetch the Bolt Cutters [2020, Epic]\"*, but this refers to the 2020 reissue/remaster, not the original 1996 release. No mention of Christgau reviewing the 1996 version was found in the provided data.  2. **Paula Cole's \"This Girl\"**:     - No entry for Paula Cole's \"This Girl\" (1996) appears in any of the Christgau-related web pages (e.g., Web Page 1’s grade list or other contexts).  **Conclusion**:  The available data does not indicate that Robert Christgau reviewed either Fiona Apple’s *Fetch the Bolt Cutters* (1996) or Paula Cole’s *This Girl* (1996). The only reference to Fiona Apple’s album is for its 2020 reissue. Further sources would be needed to confirm reviews of the original 1996 releases.  **Next Steps**:  - Investigate whether Christgau’s 1996 reviews for these albums exist in other archives or publications not captured in the provided web pages.  - Verify if \"Fetch the Bolt Cutters\" was actually released in 1996 (as stated in the previous reasoning) or if there’s confusion with its 2020 release."

PMC Copyright notice PMCID: PMC9934601  PMID: 36798355 The complete version history of this preprint is available at bioRxiv . Abstract Premise of the Research. Plants remain underrepresented among species with sequenced mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes), due to the difficulty in assembly with short-read technology. Invasive species lag behind crops and other economically important species in this respect, representing a lack of tools for management and land conservation efforts. Methodology. The mitogenome of Microstegium vimineum , one of the most damaging invasive plant species in North America, was sequenced and analyzed using long-read data, providing a resource for biologists and managers. We conducted analyses of genome content, phylogenomic analyses among grasses and relatives based on mitochondrial coding regions, and an analysis of mitochondrial single nucleotide polymorphism in this invasive grass species. Pivotal Results. The assembly is 478,010 bp in length and characterized by two large, inverted repeats, and a large, direct repeat. However, the genome could not be circularized, arguing against a “master circle” structure. Long-read assemblies with data subsets revealed several alternative genomic conformations, predominantly associated with large repeats. Plastid-like sequences comprise 2.4% of the genome, with further evidence of Class I and Class II transposable element-like sequences. Phylogenetic analysis placed M. vimineum with other Microstegium species, excluding M. nudum , but with weak support. Analysis of polymorphic sites across 112 accessions of M. vimineum from the native and invasive ranges revealed a complex invasion history. Conclusions. We present an in-depth analysis of mitogenome structure, content, phylogenetic relationships, and range-wide genomic variation in M. vimineum’s invasive US range. The mitogenome of M. vimineum is typical of other andropogonoid grasses, yet mitochondrial sequence variation across the invasive and native ranges is extensive. Our findings suggest multiple introductions to the US over the last century, with subsequent spread, secondary contact, long-distance dispersal, and possibly post-invasion selection on awn phenotypes. Efforts to produce genomic resources for invasive species, including sequenced mitochondrial genomes, will continue to provide tools for their effective management, and to help predict and prevent future invasions.

Archives, Access and Artificial Intelligence Digital Humanities Research | Volume 2Editorial Digital Humanities is an evolving, cross cutting field within the humanities em- ploying computer based methods. Research in this field, therefore, is an interdis- ciplinary endeavor that often involves researchers from the humanities as well as from computer science. This collaboration influences the methods applied as well as the theories underlying and informing research within those different fields. These implications need to be addressed according to the traditions of different humanities’ disciplines. Therefore, the edition addresses all humanities disci- plines in which digital methods are employed. Digital Humanities Research fur- thers publications from all those disciplines addressing the methodological and theoretical implications of the application of digital research in the humanities.

However, the political responses to the ecological crisis, especially at the global level, have so far been insufficient and fragmented. Development initiatives and local and national environmental policies are still not accompanied by cultural, institutional, social and ecological change that is able to pave the way for a future based on renewable energy resources, an improvement in living conditions in the poorest and least stable areas of the planet, access to basic public goods for all people geared more toward preserving the ecosystems on which human life, animals and plants depend. The collection of essays presented in this book addresses society’s need for profound ecological transformation, and in doing so intends to offer a look at paths, stories, perspectives and proposals from various different perspectives.

When we started moving our product beyond a simple REPL and started adding IDE features, we had to invent standards and wrappers around every language tool for our frontend to consume. For every editor feature, say errors and warnings (linting), we had to extend our development protocol with a set of commands and data structures, and then teach our development containers how to wrap the given tool, say Pylint, and our frontend on how to consume it (say annotate the editor with errors and warnings). A similar thing has been happening with IDEs for the past few decades -- every editor had to come up with their in-house ad-hoc protocol, and every tool developer had to build adapters and wrappers for editors to consume. However, this is about to change: a couple of years ago, Microsoft's VS Code team announced \\\"A Common Protocol for Languages\\\" , a single all-encompassing protocol that provides general-purpose language tooling -- be it refactoring, code-completion, or errors and warnings -- all implemented once and then seamlessly plugged into any editor that understands this protocol — this was dubbed the \\\"Language Server Protocol\\\" (LSP) . In addition to LSP, VS Code also open-sourced the editor that powers VS Code: Monaco . Monaco is an editor built with web technologies, and since we started looking at LSP a few months ago, it only made sense for us to transition to Monaco first. Even before the introduction of LSP on Repl.it, Monaco allowed us to provide some cool language features (Smart Autocomplete, Go to Definition, Find References) for TypeScript and JavaScript because they're bundled with the editor. On top of that, the editor has a slick feel to it. In this release, we're rolling out language servers for Python (2, 3 and Django), C, C++, and ReasonML. And soon we'll be adding support for more languages -- Java and Ruby are looking to be next in line. Let's run through some of the features: Autocomplete and signatures autocomplete and signatures Jump to definition jump to definition Find references find references Refactor refractor Linting linting Hover hover Formatting formatting Conclusion Give it a spin by going to the languages page and selecting one of the supported languages (Python, ReasonML, C, C++ for now). This release gets us one step closer to our vision of building what we call \\\" a holistic development service ,\\\" a long-lived always-on service that understands your code in all its stages and that you can use anywhere and at anytime, regardless of your device, platform, location, or your programming language. We've given ourselves the impossible task of building a top-notch ready-to-use development environment for every language under the sun. It remains to be seen whether we'll be successful at this, but what's clear is that we can't do it alone. So thank you to the VS Code team and the fantastic community building language servers for making our jobs easier. Stay tuned for more language LSP support.

You will need a macro extension: multiCommand . In your settings: \\\"multiCommand.commands\\\": [\\n\\n    {\\n      \\\"command\\\": \\\"multiCommand.removeEmptyLines\\\",\\n      // \\\"interval\\\": 50,\\n      \\\"sequence\\\": [\\n        {\\n          \\\"command\\\": \\\"type\\\",\\n          \\\"args\\\": {\\n            \\\"text\\\": \\\"^\\\\\\\\n\\\"\\n          }\\n        },\\n        \\\"cursorHomeSelect\\\",\\n        \\\"editor.action.clipboardCutAction\\\",\\n        \\\"editor.action.startFindReplaceAction\\\",\\n        \\\"editor.action.clipboardPasteAction\\\",\\n\\n        //  focus to the replace input\\n        \\\"editor.action.startFindReplaceAction\\\",\\n\\n        // clear the replace input, if any\\n        \\\"editor.action.clipboardCutAction\\\",\\n\\n        \\\"editor.action.replaceAll\\\"\\n      ]\\n    }\\n  ] It is tricky because you cannot directly write into the find widget (even with a longer delay interval).  But you can print out what you want to find, \\\" ^\\\\\\\\n \\\", select it, cut it and open the find widget and it will auto-populate the find field with the clipboard contents.  [Note the extra escape \\\"^\\\\n\\\" is necessary here.] Then there are some more commands to clear any pre-existing replace text you may have in the replace input field. Also, as you know, you must have the \\\" Use Regular Expression \\\" option toggled on.  Unfortunately, that is a toggle , there is no command for simply turning it on.  So the macro above can't invoke the toggle command - if you already had it on it would toggle off and the find would not work.  So this macro must assume you already have \\\" Use Regular Expression \\\" option toggled on.  I always leave it on and almost never find I need to toggle it off temporarily. In your keybindings.json, set up whatever keybinding you would like: {\\n    \\\"key\\\": \\\"ctrl+alt+u\\\",\\n    \\\"command\\\": \\\"multiCommand.removeEmptyLines\\\",\\n}, and then invoke that keybinding on any open line and it will trigger the macro - removing all open lines in the file (except any empty line at the very end of the file because there is no \\\\n at the end of it).

I have copied code from one file and pasted into another, however when I have pasted the code VSC has placed a blank line between every line with code. It is quite a big file so I am hoping there is a way to identify all the blank lines at once and remove them? This is how I want the code to look: <div>\\n  <h1></h1>\\n  <p></p>\\n</div> however, on paste it now looks like this: <div>\\n\\n  <h1></h1>\\n\\n  <p></p>\\n\\n</div> I have looked online but have been unable to find any direct answer to this :( visual-studio-code Share Improve this question Follow edited Jun 1, 2019 at 8:28 dippas 60.8k 15 15 gold badges 125 125 silver badges 133 133 bronze badges asked Apr 26, 2018 at 11:51 Coder Coder 1,219 1 1 gold badge 14 14 silver badges 25 25 bronze badges 0 Add a comment | 10 Answers 10 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Trending (recent votes count more) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) 279 Follow the steps In windows, Press Ctrl + H (quick replace).

I remember being at Build 2018 and asking the PM on the Live Share team if they had any plans to bring VS Code to the browser. Maybe do managed environments for labs and companies (what GitHub code spaces now is), would be great for education. Lots of students (especially non-CS nerds, like the physics kids with a CS requirement) find environment setup to be one of the hardest parts. He seemed to think I was a piece of shit for not ‘getting’ what Live Share was all about and how those other offerings (code spaces, running in the browser without install) were bad ideas not worth considering. I think the moral of the story is, if you’re a PM, don’t treat your most enthusiastic customers like shit. Or maybe do, because it won’t actually have business impact. lostintangent on Oct 20, 2021 | parent | next [–] I'm really sorry to hear you had this experience :( I'm not sure who you spoke with, but this perspective definitely isn't representative of the team and/or how I'd ever want to see us talk with developers. I'm actually a PM for both Live Share, Codespaces, and some of our education-related experiences (e.g. the GitHub Classroom extension for VS Code). A web client for collaboration, with zero-install/onboarding, has always been our north star, and so your intuition/feedback was 100% right back in 2018. Now that we have Codespaces, vscode.dev/github.dev, and Live Share support for the web, we're actually looking to further optimize our support for education, since we believe we have a lot to offer. In fact, I'd love to connect and hear your thoughts, to make sure we're going in the right direction. If you'd be interested in letting me make up for that terrible conversation in 2018, you can reach me at joncart@microsoft.com. Thanks for sharing this feedback, and letting us know where we can do better. iamstupidsimple on Oct 20, 2021 | root | parent | next [–] Hey! I'm curious how vscode.dev fits in with GitHub Codespaces. Are they competing products, or is Codespaces only a superset of the other? ezfe on Oct 21, 2021 | root | parent | next [–] Codespaces provides a backend/server so you can install plugins and run build scripts. You can't do that with this site. paxys on Oct 20, 2021 | parent | prev | next [–] On every HN thread I count the minutes until it turns into a personal rant against some big company, and it never disappoints. enumjorge on Oct 20, 2021 | root | parent | next [–] And while those stories are interesting to hear, I don’t know why they so often make it to the top or near it. Like is one PM being bad at listening to user feedback really the most interesting topic of discussion for this post? pbalau on Oct 21, 2021 | root | parent | next [–] The truth is most people lack the skills required to understand and comment of most things posted here. They also have a \\\"need\\\" to get involved in discussions, thus they cling to what they know/understand. This is why you get these anecdotes upvoted, this is why you get \\\"options\\\" on most \\\"Show HN\\\" threads. Graffur on Oct 20, 2021 | root | parent | prev | next [–] Well .. yes actually.

It was running on one of the new Slackware BSD boxes that were popular at the time. We didn't have many users but one that we did have was Jamie Zawinski - actually he was my roommate at the time.

That is what it looks like when people get together and talk to each other. Lots of us are here for that, and it seems like a pretty natural thing to do. The articles do a nice job of suggesting topics to talk about. IshKebab on Oct 21, 2021 | root | parent | next [–] It reminds me of conversations I used to have with an autistic guy who didn't really get conversational cues. He would just come out with facts that didn't at all fit the flow of the conversation. In any case I don't think the point of the articles is just to be a conversation starter. cheschire on Oct 20, 2021 | root | parent | prev | next [–] the thing i enjoy about watching that in HN vs reddit or some other ranty site is that at least on HN the actual people being ranted AT will often show up.

The Windows installation of Python is pretty stripped down, like that of Miniconda , and similarly doesn’t require admin rights to one’s computer. Therefore, I’ll cover hand-installing a few simple packages as in my older tutorial. Note:  This tutorial is aimed at non-programmers who just want to edit a few CSV files with Python.  If you’re a serious data scientist, learn the nuts and bolts of Anaconda at Real Python’s “Setting Up Python for Machine Learning on Windows” Did you get Python up and running? Yay!  I’m thrilled I could help. If you’d like, I’d love a Ko-Fi . (Chai for me!) 🥰 Installing Windows-Store Python & running a Python program Install Python from the Windows store Click the Windows icon in the bottom-left corner of your screen, and then without clicking anything else, type the word “ store .” The Windows start menu should filter your list of available programs to suggest the Microsoft Store app.  Click it. In the upper right corner of the store window, click the text entry panel next to a magnifying glass and type the word “ python ” and press enter . Available software to download should filter itself.  Click the piece of Software named “ Python #.# ” but not “ Python #.# (RC) ” where “#.#” is some number.  I suggest choosing the greatest non-RC number available to you (3.8 at the time of writing this tutorial, although as you can see in the screenshot, 3.7 is also available to me) . Verify the legitimacy of the software by checking that the Python Software Foundation is the publisher of the software, then click the big blue “ Get ” button. The button will be replaced by a meter indicating your download and installation progress. When finished, you can close the Store app. Click the Windows icon in the bottom-left corner of your screen – at the top of your start menu , you should see “ Python #.# ” and “ IDLE (Python #.#) ” software added. (Alternatively, they should be under “ P ” and “ I ,” respectively, in your start menu’s main list of programs.) If you’d like, you can click one of them and try running print('Hello') right from the Python command prompt windows they bring up, but personally, I don’t like interactive Python command lines.  I usually need to write multiple-command script files and execute them. Some tech details for nerds Skip this little list if it doesn’t make any sense to you The Windows Store seems to install copies of the Python interpreter (a.k.a. the program python.exe ) , which makes your computer understand code written in the Python programming language at both these two places – I’m not 100% sure which it’s really using, since using where python in the command line tells me one thing but various informational messages in VSCode tell me another: C:\\\\Users\\\\YOUR_USERNAME\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\WindowsApps\\\\ C:\\\\Users\\\\YOUR_USERNAME\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\WindowsApps\\\\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.#.#_LONGWEIRDTEXT\\\\ The Windows Store seems to install PIP, which helps you install and upgrade Python “mod\"\n}\n"

The blog emphasizes IDE tooling improvements rather than text-editing shortcuts or line-removal functionality. For line-removal commands, other sources like Stack Overflow and community blogs suggest using **regular expressions** (e.g., `^\\\\s*$\\\\n` in Find/Replace) or extensions like **\"Remove Empty Lines\"**. However, these solutions are not tied to the 2018 Replit blog post. The requested command from the blog does not appear to exist in the provided content."

We will assume the Tropicos ID is the first 9 digits of an ISBN-10 number and find the 10th digit (check digit).\n\n3. **Calculate the check digit:**\n   - The check digit in an ISBN-10 is calculated by taking the sum of the products of each digit and its position (starting from 10 and decreasing to 1), and then finding the remainder when this sum is divided by 11.\n   - For the Tropicos ID 500002451, we will use the digits 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 5, 1.\n\n4. **Perform the calculation:**\n   - (5 * 10) + (0 * 9) + (0 * 8) + (0 * 7) + (0 * 6) + (2 * 5) + (4 * 4) + (5 * 3) + (1 * 2)\n   - = 50 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 10 + 16 + 15 + 2\n   - = 93\n\n5. **Find the check digit:**\n   - The check digit is the remainder when 93 is divided by 11.\n   - 93 % 11 = 4\n\nTherefore, the check digit for the Tropicos ID 500002451 if it were an ISBN-10 number would be 4.\n\n\\boxed{4}",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the Tropicos ID for the Order Helotiales:**\n   - The Tropicos ID for the Order Helotiales is 500002451.\n\n2. **Convert the Tropicos ID to an ISBN-10 format:**\n   - An ISBN-10 number is a 10-digit number. We will assume the Tropicos ID is the first 9 digits of an ISBN-10 number and find the 10th digit (check digit).\n\n3. **Calculate the check digit:**\n   - The check digit in an ISBN-10 is calculated by taking the sum of the products of each digit and its position (starting from 10 and decreasing to 1), and then finding the remainder when this sum is divided by 11.\n   - For the Tropicos ID 500002451, we will use the digits 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 5, 1.\n\n4. **Perform the calculation:**\n   - (5 * 10) + (0 * 9) + (0 * 8) + (0 * 7) + (0 * 6) + (2 * 5) + (4 * 4) + (5 * 3) + (1 * 2)\n   - = 50 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 10 + 16 + 15 + 2\n   - = 93\n\n5. **Find the check digit:**\n   - The check digit is the remainder when 93 is divided by 11.\n   - 93 % 11 = 4\n\nTherefore, the check digit for the Tropicos ID 500002451 if it were an ISBN-10 number would be 4.\n\n\\boxed{4}"

The Tri prefix in the name refers to the three counties served by the railroad: Palm Beach , Broward , and Miami-Dade . [ 3 ] Tri-Rail is managed by the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority (SFRTA) along CSX Transportation 's former Miami Subdivision ; [ 4 ] [ 5 ] the line is now wholly owned by the Florida DOT . The 80.0-mile-long (128.7 km) system has 19 stations along the Southeast Florida coast, and connects directly to Amtrak at numerous stations, to Metrorail at the Metrorail Transfer station , Miami Airport station , and MiamiCentral , and to Brightline at MiamiCentral. In 2024, the line had a ridership of 4,952,500, or about 16,000 per weekday as of the first quarter of 2025. A second Tri-Rail line on the Florida East Coast Railway corridor, dubbed the \\\"Coastal Link\\\", has been proposed. The line would operate between Toney Penna station in Jupiter and MiamiCentral in Downtown Miami , and add commuter rail service between the downtown areas of cities between West Palm Beach and Miami. Combined with the existing Tri-Rail line, this expanded Tri-Rail system is estimated to have a daily passenger ridership of almost 30,000; or approximately 9 million passengers per annum, doubling Tri-Rail's current ridership. History [ edit ] The West Palm Beach station , built in 1925, is one of the many original stations built by the Seaboard-All Florida Railway in the 1920s. Today, these stations are used by Tri-Rail and Amtrak. 1920s: Seaboard-All Florida Railway [ edit ] See also: Seaboard-All Florida Railway The line on which Tri-Rail operates was built by the Seaboard-All Florida Railway (a subsidiary of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad ) for intercity passenger rail service in the early 1920s. The line was inaugurated on January 7, 1927. Intercity rail service by Seaboard operated the Orange Blossom Special service from New York City until 1953. Amtrak continues to offer passenger rail service with the Floridian train from Chicago and Silver Meteor train from New York City . [ 6 ] Today, the original 1920s Seaboard stations are used by Tri-Rail for service at West Palm Beach , Deerfield Beach , Fort Lauderdale , Hollywood . Though no longer in use, the Seaboard stations at Delray Beach , Opa-locka and Hialeah are still standing. 1980s–1990s: Planning and inauguration [ edit ] Planning for a new commuter rail line began in 1983, and building the organization began in 1986. The current system was formed by the Florida Department of Transportation and began operation January 9, 1989, to provide temporary commuter rail service while construction crews widened Interstate 95 and the parallel Florida's Turnpike . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Tri-Rail was free from opening until June 1, 1989. [ 9 ] Due to higher than expected ridership, FDOT made Tri-Rail a permanent service, adding more trains and stations in the process. [ citation needed ] The state's original plan was to use the more urban Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) line, but FEC declined the offer as it \"\n}\n**Web Page 7:**\n{\n  \"id\": 7,\n  \"title\": \"Tri-Rail - Facebook\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.facebook.com/trirail/\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Tri-Rail, Pompano Beach. 23014 likes · 240 talking about this · 2585 were here.

Powered by Moovit’s mobility solutions and Genfare’s fare payment technology, the app will simplify travel for residents and visitors alike. Seamless Transit Across South Florida SoFloGO brings together four major transit systems—Tri-Rail, BCT, Palm Tran, and DTPW’s Metrorail, Metrobus, and Metromover services—into one intuitive platform. The app offers multimodal trip planning, real-time arrival updates, live directions, mobile ticketing, and service alerts, creating a unified travel experience across county lines. The app’s user-friendly features include deboarding alerts and step-by-step guidance for entire journeys, making it easier than ever to navigate South Florida’s diverse transportation network. With an inclusive design, the app also prioritizes accessibility, offering screen reader compatibility, step-free route options, and optimized navigation for riders with mobility challenges. Meeting the Region’s Growing Transit Needs As South Florida’s population and visitor numbers continue to rise, the demand for efficient, interconnected transit solutions has become critical. SoFloGO addresses these needs by consolidating transit options into one cohesive app, providing riders with a reliable and efficient way to navigate Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties. “We are thrilled to introduce the SoFloGO app, a dream come true for South Florida public transportation,” said David Dech, SFRTA Executive Director. “Every day, people use our transit services to cross city and county lines interchangeably. This app integrates all the services they need in one place, making regional travel more convenient than ever before.” “SoFloGo is a game-changer for public transit in South Florida, and especially for the residents of Broward County, bringing together multiple transportation systems into one seamless experience,” said Coree Cuff Lonergan, CEO/General Manager of Broward County Transit. “For the first time, our riders have a single, seamless way to plan trips and pay fares across county lines. This collaboration represents a major step forward in making transit more accessible, efficient, and user-friendly.” “Whenever we can leverage innovative technologies to make public transportation easier and more appealing, everybody wins,” said DTPW Director Stacy Miller. “This is an important step forward that our partners at the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority are taking to enhance our customers’ experience.” “Palm Tran is looking forward to the launch of the SoFLoGo app,” said Palm Tran Executive Director Ivan Maldonado. “It’s a great tool that will help connect riders to the different transportation services throughout South Florida.” Features of the SoFloGO App Multimodal Trip Planning: Suggests optimized routes across buses and trains. Real-Time Information: Provides live tracking of buses and trains to minimize wait times. Mobile Ticketing: Enables seamless fare payment from each transit agency directly within the app. Live Directions and Alerts: Offers step-by-step guidance, including service alerts to avoid disruptions. Accessibility Features: Ensures inclusivity with screen readers, step-free route options, and ergonomic menus. The development of SoFloGO was made possible through funding from the Broward Metropolitan Planning Organization, whose generous support reflects the region’s vision of fare interoperability and enhanced connectivity. The app is available for download on the App Store and Google Play . For more information, visit SoFloGO’s webpage at https://soflogo.com .

World Building Edited by Marta Boni World Building Transmedia, Fans, IndustriesWorld BuildingTransmedia: Participatory Culture and Media Convergence The book series Transmedia: Participatory Culture and Media Convergence provides a platform for cutting-edge research in the field of media studies, with a strong focus on the impact of digitization, globalization, and fan culture. The series is dedicated to publishing the highest-quality monographs (and exceptional edited collections) on the developing social, cultural, and economic practices surrounding media convergence and audience participation. The term ‘media convergence’ relates to the complex ways in which the production, distribution, and consumption of contemporary media are affected by digitization, while ‘participatory culture’ refers to the changing relationship between media producers and their audiences. Interdisciplinary by its very definition, the series will provide a publishing platform for international scholars doing new and critical research in relevant fields. While the main focus will be on contemporary media culture, the series is also open to research that focuses on the historical forebears of digital convergence culture, including histories of fandom, cross- and transmedia franchises, reception studies and audience ethnographies, and critical approaches to the culture industry and commodity culture.

Theoretical constructs within globalization and literacy studies are used to describe the influences of new media and technologies on modern configurations of imagination, identity, communication, and writing. Findings suggest that through their participation in online fan-related activities, these three youth are using language and other representational resources to enact cosmopolitan identities, make transnational social connections, and experiment with new genres and formats for composing. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Fiction is reality: designing liminal experiences for global fandom Steven Cober Over the last three decades, increasingly zealous fan communities have reinterpreted, remixed, and subverted characters from global franchises such as Star Wars, Marvel, and Harry Potter to bring themselves closer to the fiction. The resulting fan culture and recent advancements in digital-physical technologies provide a new opportunity to connect passionate fans with iconic properties that reform the traditional cultural orthodoxy and create added value experiences for high budget entertainment and cultural properties. This research project was focused on enabling participants to deepen their affinity to such narratives through a framework for immersive play within a participatory liminal space. This framework was embodied as a digitally enabled physical device that engaged users through multisensory interactions, versatile customization, inter-device communications and a foundation for systemic agency. As a diegetic prototype, it presented opportunities for participants to meaning... download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right AUDIENCE ENGAGEMENT WITH MULTI-LEVEL FICTIONAL UNIVERSES: THE CASE OF GAME OF THRONES AND ITS ITALIAN FANS Carmen Spanò PARTICIPATIONS: Journal of Audience & Reception Studies, 2016 In the current multi-modal environment rich in on-demand content, audiences operate as active users of media content by exercising control over their viewing schedules, and by integrating media texts into their lives according to new patterns of consumption. My analysis focuses on the relationship between Italian fans and the transmedia structure of the popular television series Game of Thrones. The show's imaginary universe has been conceived in a way that allows complex and diverse forms of audience engagement. Indeed, Game of Thrones' transmedia narratives constitute a 'world-building experience, unfolding content and generating the possibilities for the story to evolve with new and pertinent content' (Gambarato 2012, p.4). The complexity of the experience(s) is determined by the existence of sub-worlds within the Game of Thrones' universe: the literary one, the one recreated on screen and one that is built on the media extensions that enrich and deepen the storylines and the characters' profiles. This multi-level architecture offers audience members different venues of consumption as well as the possibility to appropriate original media content in order to produce and distribute new content as a result of individuals' free labor; this means that convergence (Jenkins, 2006) can become a 'field of struggle' between media conglomerates and empowered consumers. The investigation of Italian fans' immersion into Game of Thrones' transmedia framework, therefore, aims at identifying the concrete practices that fans engage in as determined by their exploitation of the universe of the text and their ability to re-work/re-use original material from that universe in alternative ways, outside of the established paths provided by traditional media producers in the first place. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Fandom: Identities and Communities in a Mediated World New York and London: New York University Press (2007) ISBN: 978-0814731826 (paperback), pp.  … Cornel Sandvoss participations.org download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Hypermodern media culture and its audiences Jan Visnovsky 2024 The presented monograph primarily examines the ways in which people establish contacts with media content in the cultural reality and under the technological and economic conditions of the 21st century. The publication aims to respond to current questions shaping media audience research, whether in relation to the existence and formation of the so-called hypermodern media culture, or within the framework of broader considerations about the promotion of media content and fan activities, which in the last twenty years have become a self-evident and automatically expected part of our daily interactions with media content. Media audiences express their increasing sensitivity towards social issues, actively participating in public life and political affairs – whether they realise it or not. The proclaimed loss of authenticity seems to be the essential problem, as media audiences are quick to recognise pretentious content and badly executed promotional campaigns. The authors aim to discuss a range of problems which stretch beyond the boundaries of media and communication studies, influencing everyday life, political stances and consumer behaviour under the conditions of ideologically polarised Western world. The publication is primarily interesting for media and marketing scholars, as well as for media professionals and marketing experts specialising in pr\"\n}\n**Web Page 5:**\n{\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"title\": \"Introduction: Worlds, Today - World Building Transmedia Fans ...\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/world-building-transmedia-fans-industries/introduction-worlds-today/FD502600E9E502DBA0B233A3CAC52210\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"...

My paper will be structured into three parts: first, I will provide a definition of the above mentioned strategies, including their main effects; second, I will discuss how the relationships between the use of these strategies, the participatory or networked culture of fandom and world-making practices can be interpreted and analyzed; and finally, I will focus on the case of the TV series Supernatural. ...

        "turn_1_webpage_analyses": "Valentina Re's contribution to the 2017 book *World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries* is a chapter titled **\"The Monster at the End of This Book: Metalepsis, Fandom, and World Making in Contemporary TV Series\"** (Chapter 18). In this chapter, she examines the use of **metalepsis** (a narrative device that blurs boundaries between narrative levels, such as dream and reality) in transmedia storytelling, focusing on the TV series *Supernatural* and its fan practices. While the provided web page snippets do not explicitly name a specific horror *movie* that popularized metalepsis, Re’s analysis centers on *Supernatural* (a horror/fantasy TV series) as a key example of metaleptic storytelling. The chapter discusses how such narrative strategies foster world-building and audience engagement, particularly through fan-driven participatory culture.  **Key Points from Searched Pages:**  1. **Chapter Title and Focus**: The chapter analyzes metalepsis in TV series (e.g., *Supernatural*) and its role in world-making, emphasizing fan participation.  2. **Context in the Book**: The chapter is part of Section 5 (\"Appropriations and Fan Practices\"), highlighting fan-driven extensions of storyworlds.  3. **Metalepsis and Transmedia**: Re links metalepsis to narrative techniques that bridge fictional and real-world layers, though the specific horror movie cited (if any) is not visible in the provided snippets.  The information confirms Re’s focus on *Supernatural* but does not identify a horror movie as the primary example. Further details about a specific film would require accessing the full chapter text."

From his time in Venice and Rome, El Greco would have been familiar with Titian’s psychologically charged portraits. He has intensified his sitter’s inner life through animated brushwork, a reduced palette, and the cardinal’s frontal gaze. The angularity of the garment as it falls to the floor and the tension of the man’s left hand suggest an electricity held in check. In 1599 Niño de Guevara became inquisitor general of Spain. He resigned in 1602 and served the rest of his life as archbishop of Seville. Beginning in 1906, French and German publications on El Greco regularly identified this as among the artist’s greatest portraits.

Havemeyer, 1929 Object Number: 29.100.5 This celebrated picture—a landmark in the history of European portraiture—has become emblematic not only of El Greco but also of Spain and the Spanish Inquisition. Fernando Niño de Guevara, from a noble family of Toledo, rose to prominence under Philip II and was named cardinal in 1596. Here he wears a cardinal’s biretta (cap), mozzetta (cape), and rochet (the lace-trimmed garment). In April 1599 he was nominated as Inquisitor General by Philip III but served in that office for only two years, since the king’s favorite, the Duke of Lerma, was determined to place his own uncle in the cardinal’s position. To that end, evidently, Niño de Guevara was appointed Archbishop of Seville, which he remained until his death on January 8, 1609.

But it is an emotive rather than a documentary vision that not only imaginatively revises the skyline—most notably, the cathedral has been moved—but also distorts architecture and landscape such that they are fully in service of the kind of drama Rilke and other modernists appreciated in his work.

In this version, from the last years of the painter's life, the saint is shown in the red vestments of a cardinal, seated before an open book, an attribute indicating his role as translator of the Bible from Greek into Latin in the fifth century. His gaunt features and long white beard refer to his familiar guise as a penitent, recalling his retreat to the Syrian desert. The painting is notable for the novel way in which the artist synthesized the two aspects of Saint Jerome, the scholarly and the ascetic.

Artwork Details Use your arrow keys to navigate the tabs below, and your tab key to choose an item Overview Catalogue Entry Provenance Title: Saint Jerome as Scholar Artist: El Greco (Domenikos Theotokopoulos) (Greek, Iráklion (Candia) 1541–1614 Toledo) Date: ca. 1610 Medium: Oil on canvas Dimensions: 42 1/2 x 35 1/16 in. (108 x 89 cm) Classification: Paintings Credit Line: Robert Lehman Collection, 1975 Object Number: 1975.1.146 El Greco and his workshop produced several paintings of Saint Jerome as a scholar. The two finest are in New York: a signed canvas (110.5 x 95.3 cm) in the Frick Collection, probably of the 1590s, and the present picture, which is generally considered to be an autograph replica of the following decade. Christiansen (in New York-London 2003-4, p. 190) reports that a direct comparison of the two paintings in 2001 demonstrated that despite their closeness in design, their \\\"color harmonies and brushwork are strikingly different,\\\" and that the palette is paler and more brilliant in the Lehman version, and the execution broader. Similar differences in style are evident in El Greco’s portraits and religious pictures of the same decades. The portrait-like quality of the face has often been noted, and in the past led to identifications with known contemporaries of the artist (see J. Brown in Sterling et al. 1998, p. 174). It seems likely that El Greco referred to a live model but not to a person who was meant to be recognized as a prominent churchman or other public figure in Toledo. However, a scholarly prelate, of the sort known to have commissioned works from El Greco (such as Pedro Salazar de Mendoza; see The Vision of Saint John; MMA 56.48), would have been a potential client for a painting of Saint Jerome, especially one presenting him in such a straightforward manner, standing at a desk in private, with a thumb marking his place in a book. It has been suggested that the cardinal has been interrupted by the viewer, but this conceit, common enough in portraits of living scholars and collectors, is clearly implausible given his unfocussed glance to the side.

The artist was himself a poet, delighting as much in the beauty of language as he did in the witty and fanciful details of his paintings. Here, Bronzino employs the ancient Roman tradition of fantastical decorations known as grotesques in his rendering of heads on the table and chair, and in the almost hidden, mask-like face suggested in the folds of the youth’s breeches. While these monstrous faces contrast with the youth’s handsome looks, they may also imply that his carefully crafted appearance is similarly a kind of mask.

How long will it last? This month, Nature Photonics presents a focus issue dedicated to the field of surface plasmon polariton photonics, or 'plasmonics'. The term plasmonics might be new, but the interaction of light with charges at surfaces is not. Joachim Krenn, from the University of Graz, Austria, and one of the founders of the modern field of plasmonics, mentions in an interview on page 714 that people were formulating ideas over 100 years ago that still hold relevance to plasmonics researchers today. The coupling of light to charges at metal surfaces is also cited as being utilized hundreds (or even thousands) of years before that, but the science at the time was not known and the crediting of some cases (for example the coloration of some particular historical artefacts) to plasmonics may be incorrect. Following the early work of Maxwell Garnett and others in about 1904, there were periods of revival in the field every ten years or so. Using a few relevant search terms on the database Scopus shows that in the decade before 1990 about 200 papers related to plasmons were published per year. (Of course, the numbers mentioned here will vary depending on search terms and conditions, but the trends may remain similar.) Most of these papers would not be considered particularly relevant to surface plasmon photonics or plasmonics. In the 1980s and 1990s, there were a lot of developments that contributed to the modern revival of plasmonics. In particular there was the work on surface-enhanced Raman scattering. Additionally, advances in tools for characterizing structures (scanning electron and atomic force microscopy), fabrication (electron-beam and ion-beam lithography) and nanoscale imaging of light (near-field scanning microscopy) were key catalysts for the explosion of research in the past decade or so. According to the search terms used, by around 2001 there had been a fivefold increase in manuscripts since 1990. Even then, the number of papers to read per month that were truly relevant to those working directly on modern plasmonics was manageable. However, by 2011 another fivefold increase had occurred, and within recent years plasmonics has become arguably the most populated field of research in optics. An interesting field to compare the rise of plasmonics to is photonic crystals. After their discovery in the late 1980s, there were still only a few papers per year until about 1995 (or particularly 2000), when the field experienced a rise to the forefront of photonics. However, although there are obviously still many people publishing a large number of papers in the field, the growth collapsed in around 2004. By contrast, plasmonics has yet to show any signs of wavering. It should be noted that many of the papers revealed by the search terms that are published prior to the year 2000 are not relevant to modern plasmonics and the data should be interpreted cautiously. The sheer number of publications in plasmonics does invite questions regarding quality versus quantity. How many of the works being published are truly novel?

Using metallic nanostructures with tailored shapes, it is possible to efficiently focus light into nanoscale field ‘hot spots’. High field enhancement factors have been achieved in such optical nanoantennas, enabling transformative science in the areas of single molecule interactions, highly enhanced nonlinearities and nanoscale waveguiding. Unfortunately, these large enhancements come at the price of high optical losses due to absorption in the metal, severely limiting real-world applications. Via the realization of a novel nanophotonic platform based on dielectric nanostructures to form efficient nanoantennas with ultra-low light-into-heat conversion, here we demonstrate an approach that overcomes these limitations. We show that dimer-like silicon-based single nanoantennas produce both high surface enhanced fluorescence and surface enhanced Raman scattering, while at the same time generating a negligible temperature increase in their hot spots and surrounding environments.

This local enhancement is due to the resonant excitation of surface plasmons, collective oscillations of the conducting electrons in metals 2 . Enhanced light-matter interactions mediated by plasmons enable many applications, such as information processing 3 , ultrasensitive (bio)detection 4 , surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) 5 , 6 , surface enhanced fluorescence (SEF) 7 and nonlinear spectroscopy 8 , 9 , 10 . Gold and silver are commonly used in plasmonic devices because of their high DC conductivities 11 , 12 . However, at optical frequencies interband transitions play a detrimental role in these metals 13 . Losses arising from interband transitions occur when a valence electron in the metal absorbs a photon to jump to the Fermi surface or when an electron near the Fermi surface absorbs a photon to jump to the next unoccupied state in the conduction band 14 , 15 . This loss mechanism leads to Joule heating of the structure and its local environment 16 . In recent years several applications, such as photothermal cancer therapy 17 , photothermal imaging 18 , catalytic process enhancement in photocatalysis 19 and photohermal biosensing 20 have been proposed to take advantage of this nanoscale-generated (that is, highly localized) heat in metallic-based plasmonic nanoantennas. For many other applications, however, localized heating is extremely detrimental for both the application/experiment and for the nanoantennas themselves 21 , 22 . Local heating of the plasmonic structures changes their refractive indices via the thermo-optic effect. Depending on the illuminating power, nanoantennas can even be reshaped and/or melted, thus strongly affecting their nanoscale lighting and photonic modulation capabilities 23 . Moreover, heat generated by the nanoantennas can vapourize the surrounding liquid/solvent media 24 or affect nanoemitters, molecules and proteins close to them 25 . To circumvent the issues of losses and heating, the use of non-plasmonic materials, such as silicon, germanium or gallium phosphide (high refractive index dielectrics), has been theoretically proposed for the fabrication of nanoantennas with the ability to confine and enhance near and far-field light 26 , 27 . The magneto-optical response 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 and directional light scattering 33 , 34 , 35 of these materials have been explored an\"\n}\n**Web Page 5:**\n{\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"title\": \"Ultrasmall all-optical plasmonic switch and its application to ... - Nature\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep24293\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Here we show that scattering from a plasmonic nanoparticle, whose volume is smaller than 0.001 μm 3 , can be optically switched off with less than 100 μW power.\",\n  \"context\": \"Ultrasmall all-optical plasmonic switch and its application to superresolution imaging | Scientific Reports Skip to main content Thank you for visiting nature.com.

However, all-optical modulation of plasmonic response with nanometer mode volume and unity modulation depth is still lacking. Here we show that scattering from a plasmonic nanoparticle, whose volume is smaller than 0.001 μm 3 , can be optically switched off with less than 100 μW power. Over 80% modulation depth is observed and shows no degradation after repetitive switching. The spectral bandwidth approaches 100 nm. The underlying mechanism is suggested to be photothermal effects and the effective single-particle nonlinearity reaches nearly 10 −9 m 2 /W, which is to our knowledge the largest record of metallic materials to date. As a novel application, the non-bleaching and unlimitedly switchable scattering is used to enhance optical resolution to λ/5 (λ/9 after deconvolution), with 100-fold less intensity requirement compared to similar superresolution techniques. Our work not only opens up a new field of ultrasmall all-optical control based on scattering from a single nanoparticle, but also facilitates superresolution imaging for long-term observation.

The major issue that slows down recent development of electronic circuits is the loss at interconnects. Photonic circuits can provide less losses with higher densities of information 1 . To advance electronic circuit into photonic circuit, active components such as all-optical switches are indispensible. An ideal all-optical switch should fulfill several important requirements: (i) as small as nanoscale in size; (ii) high speed; (iii) large switching modulation depth; (iv) low-power request; (v) broadband operation. Recently, various schemes of all-optical switches have been proposed/demonstrated. The majority of them relies on cavity effects, such as photonic crystal nanocavities 2 , silicon-based microring resonator 3 , individual semiconductor nanowires 4 and quantum Zeno effect 5 . The advantages of using cavities are outstanding switching modulation depth with reduced energy request. Single-photon switch has been achieved by coupling photonic crystal cavities with a quantum dot 6 , 7 . The capability of cascading and multiple fan-out has been demonstrated 8 . However, due to the existence of cavities, the switch size cannot meet the demand of nanoscale. The quantum Zeno switch requires bulky optical elements. The microring resonator is much smaller, but the diameter of the ring is on the order of 10 μm.

PMC Copyright notice PMCID: PMC5460164  PMID: 28588234 Abstract Plasmon-induced phenomena have recently attracted considerable attention. At the same time, relatively little research has been conducted on electrochemistry mediated by plasmon excitations. Here we report plasmon-induced formation of nanoscale quantized conductance filaments within metal-insulator-metal heterostructures. Plasmon-enhanced electromagnetic fields in an array of gold nanodots provide a straightforward means of forming conductive CrO x bridges across a thin native chromium oxide barrier between the nanodots and an underlying metallic Cr layer. The existence of these nanoscale conducting filaments is verified by transmission electron microscopy and contact resistance measurements. Their conductance was interrogated optically, revealing quantised relative transmission of light through the heterostructures across a wavelength range of 1–12 μm. Such plasmon-induced electrochemical processes open up new possibilities for the development of scalable devices governed by light. Introduction Due to high field compression and enhancement ratios 1 , plasmonics promise to bring about advances in optics 2 , improve bio-sensing 3 and optical trapping 4 , and speed-up data communications 5 . Recently, plasmon-induced phenomena 6 , 7 , particularly in hybrid plasmonic systems 8 , have attracted considerable attention. Plasmon-induced hot carriers could ensure progress in photovoltaics 6 , fast electronics and photo-chemistry 7 , as well as catalytic reactions 9 including those required for green energy production 10 . At the same time, relatively little research has been conducted on plasmon-induced electrochemistry which can be very useful for creation of resistive random access memory (RRAM) devices. RRAM is a promising candidate for the next generation of nonvolatile memory 11 – 15 . It consists of a simple metal-insulator-metal (MIM) layered structure, and is based upon the principle of controllable switching between different electrical resistance states. Such switching can be achieved through the formation and dissolution of nanoscale conductive filaments (CFs) 13 – 15 . Among the numerous demonstrations of RRAM nanocells reported to date 11 – 22 , a great deal of attention has been given to CF-based approaches due to their superior performance characteristics (low electrical switching powers, high speed operation and technological scalability) and easy CMOS integration (simple material systems and structures) 18 – 22 . A variety of oxide, chalcogenide, and sulphide thin films have been proposed for use as the solid electrolyte core material 13 – 16 . Application of a sufficient voltage across the electrodes leads to field-assisted injection and transport of cations within the insulator, and hence the growth of a CF and the creation of a memory cell 19 – 22 . In most cases CFs are detected by recording the resistance state of studied RRAM nanocells, which sometimes exhibit quantised conductance 23 . One area of particular interest is that of all-optical memory devices, where both the writing and reading of information is performed by light. Recently, we found a system which could be a viable candidate for all-optical memory based on CFs. To explain the quantised relative transparency of plasmonic nanoarrays 24 , we suggested that conductive filaments can be fo\"\n}\n**Web Page 7:**\n{\n  \"id\": 7,\n  \"title\": \"(PDF) Plasmonics: Visit the past to know the future - ResearchGate\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258260972_Plasmonics_Visit_the_past_to_know_the_future\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Plasmonics is a rapidly growing and well-established research field, which covers various aspects of surface plasmons towards realization of a variety of ...\",\n  \"context\": \"HTTP error occurred: 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258260972_Plasmonics_Visit_the_past_to_know_the_future\"\n}\n**Web Page 8:**\n{\n  \"id\": 8,\n  \"title\": \"Position-sensitive spectral splitting with a plasmonic nanowire on ...\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep03095\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"This study provides a new and promising approach for realizing spatiotemporal-sensitive spectral splitting and optical signal processing on nanoscales.\",\n  \"context\": \"Position-sensitive spectral splitting with a plasmonic nanowire on silicon chip | Scientific Reports Skip to main content Thank you for visiting nature.com.

With the capabilities of confining light into (deep) subwavelength volumes, plasmonics makes it possible to dramatically miniaturize optical devices so as to integrate them into silicon chips. Here we demonstrate that by cascading nano-corrugation gratings with different periodicities on silver nanowires atop silicon, different colors can be spatially separated and chronologically released at different grating junctions. The released light frequency depends on the grating arrangement and corrugation periodicities. Hence the nanowire acts as a spectral splitter for sorting/demultiplexing photons at different nano-scale positions with a ten-femtosecond-level interval. Such nanowires can be constructed further into compact 2D networks or circuits. We believe that this study provides a new and promising approach for realizing spatiotemporal-sensitive spectral splitting and optical signal processing on nanoscales and for general integration of nanophotonics with microelectronics.

These spectral technologies have been based on traditional filters, mirrors, or interferometers, which are clumsy in size (much larger than the wavelength) and difficult to be integrated into microelectronics 7 . By relying on the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology 8 , 9 , 10 , some on-chip spectral devices, such as light in/out couplers 11 , 12 , 13 and demultiplexers 14 , 15 , have been successfully developed in the infrared regime, particularly for telecommunication wavelengths. Yet for visible frequencies, the silicon-based technology fails to work efficiently due to the strong inherent absorption of silicon. Consequently, on-chip integration of photonic devices has been limited by their larger-than-wavelength sizes and the weak optical response of silicon 16 . Fortunately, as a product of the interaction between photons and free electrons at the metal-dielectric interface, surface plasmons (SPs) can achieve extremely small mode wavelengths and high localized electromagnetic fields. Hence, plasmonics with (deep) subwavelength characteristics may break the diffraction limit of light and thus are promising for modulating photons on nanoscales 17 , 18 , 19 so as to bridge the gap between nanoelectronics and optics 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 . In fact, plasmonic structures have shown potential applications as nano waveguides and circuits 24 , 25 , 26 , nanoantennas 27 , 28 , submicron dichroic splitters 29 , photonic sorters 30 and logic gates 31 , etc. However, to date it is still very challenging to make plasmonic devices compatible with the current complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, mainly due to the large impedance mismatch across the metal-dielectric interface 32 , 33 . Recently, by introducing hybrid plasmon polaritons 34 , 35 , researchers have experimentally realized low-loss optical waveguiding on deep subwavelength scales 36 , where the higher optical loss mode, termed as the dielectric-loaded-surface-plasmon-polariton (DLSPP) mode 37 , 38 , is intentionally converted to a lower hybrid loss mode. But this technique again remains incompatible with the current silicon technology. Therefore, the key issue to advance this field is to explore the possibilities of integrating plasmonic nanostructures on silicon wafers, which is obviously of significant importance for combining nanophotonics and microelectronics and has been attracting intense interest in recent years.

PMC Copyright notice PMCID: PMC5997993  PMID: 29899340 Abstract We demonstrate numerically and experimentally the enhancement of Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) sensing via dispersion engineering of the plasmonic response using plasmonic nanograting. Following their design and optimization, the plasmonic nanograting structures are fabricated using e-beam lithography and lift-off process and integrated into conventional prism based Kretschmann configuration. The presence of absorptive nanograting near the metal film, provides strong field enhancement with localization and allows to control the dispersion relation which was originally dictated by a conventional SPR structure. This contributes to the enhancement in Q factor which is found to be 3–4 times higher as compared to the conventional Kretschmann configuration. The influence of the incident angle on resonance wavelength is also demonstrated both numerically and experimentally, where, only a negligible wavelength shift is observed with increasing the incident angles for plasmonic nanograting configuration. This surprising feature may be helpful for studying and utilizing light-matter interaction between plasmons and narrow linewidth media (e.g. Rb atom or molecule) having nonlocalities in their susceptibility-momentum relation. Finally, we analyze the role of plasmonic nanograting in enhancing the performance of an SPR sensor. Our results indicate that the integrated SPR-nanograting device shows a great promise as a sensor for various types of analytes. Introduction Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) is an electromagnetic wave propagating along a metal-dielectric interface, coupled to oscillations of electrons in the metal. The coupling of light into SPPs requires phase matching, where the phase velocity of the surface plasmon wave and of the lateral component of the incident light become equal 1 , 2 . Being localized at the interface, the SPP wave is extremely sensitive to minute changes in refractive index of the dielectric medium, in the vicinity of the interface 3 , 4 . One of the most common techniques to excite the SPP for sensing is the Kretschmann configuration 5 , 6 , where the signature of SPP excitation results in a decrease in the intensity of the reflected light from the metal surface for a particular resonance angle or wavelength 7 – 9 . Commonly, to achieve high sensitivity, the resonance linewidth should be as narrow as possible. Unfortunately, plasmonic resonances are typically broad, mostly due to Ohmic loss in the metal 10 . In this regard, coating the Kretschmann configuration prism by thin multilayers was recently reported theoretically and shown experimentally to allow the engineering of the dispersion curve 11 , 12 . Periodic structures have been shown to provide better figure of merit for sensing via dispersion engineering and in particular via the increase in group index, leading to the narrowing of the resonance linewidth 13 , 14 . Indeed, enhanced sensitivity detection based on dispersion engineering using metallic gratings applied upon thin metal coated prism has been reported theoretically 15 – 18 , but to this end, no experimental results have been reported demonstrating the enhanced sensitivity with the metal \"\n}\n"

Learn about our editorial policies Corbis via Getty Images / Getty Images Close The incredible run of Apple stock has been well-documented, alongside the company’s history and ground-breaking products. A $100 investment in the company’s stock at the beginning of 2002 would have grown to more than 520 times the original investment as of October 2024. All Apple stock price quotes in this article are outright prices, not prices adjusted for dividends and splits. The effect of stock splits is noted and calculated into the total result. But, the impact of dividends, which would slightly enhance the value of the investment, is not reflected. Key Takeaways On October 21, 2024, Apple closed at $236.22. Multiplied by 224, an initial investment of $100 would be worth approximately $52,913.28. Apple launched its initial public offering (IPO) on December 12, 1980, selling 46 million shares at $22. The company's shares sold out almost immediately; at that point in time, no other company had generated more capital with its public offering since Ford went public in 1956. Apple's Initial Public Offering (IPO) Apple launched its initial public offering (IPO) on December 12, 1980, selling 46 million shares at $22. The company's shares sold out almost immediately; at that point in time, no other company had generated more capital with its public offering since Ford went public in 1956. Because of the large number of shareholders, the company had to hold its first shareholder meeting as a public company at De Anza College's Flint Center in Cupertino. Gradual Ascent to Prominence and Profits It’s easy to view Apple as a monumental success story now. However, the beginning of this investment adventure wouldn't have started well. The closing share price quoted for Apple for Jan. 2, 2002, the first trading day of the year, was $23.30. Rounding to the nearest whole share, a $100 investment would have secured four shares of Apple's stock. But, by the end of 2002, the stock price declined to $14.33 a share. In terms of the hypothetical $100 investment in this article, this would have represented an approximately 40% loss. However, the next couple of years were lucrative for Apple investors; the company continued to grow in the marketplace—as a result of more advanced versions of its popular iPod and the opening of the iTunes store in 2003. By the end of 2004, Apple’s stock price climbed to $64.40 per share, making an original investment of $100 now worth $257.60. A Stock Split and Continuing Climb In February 2005, Apple initiated a two-for-one stock split , which would have transformed the original investment into a total of eight shares. In 2006, Apple debuted the MacBook Pro, the second Apple desktop computer product that used Intel’s core duo processor. In 2007, it followed up with the launch of the iPhone, which revolutionized the cell phone industry. The iPhone 3G followed in 2008, and in 2010, the iPhone 4 was introduced, along with another soon-to-be wildly successful product, the iPad. The stock's closing price at the end of 2005 was $71.89, making the total value of the investment $575.12. Two years later, the 2007 closing price was $198.08, making the hypothetical investment worth $1,584.64. The stock suffered approximately a 50% downside retracement in 2008, closing out the year at $85.35 a share.

Not only is the consumer technology giant the first publicly traded outfit to reach a trillion-dollar market cap, it's also often the world's most profitable company. It has earned its status as an investor favorite. Apple's stock has split several times since its initial public offering back in 1980, of course. It essentially had to, in order to accommodate the organization's incredible growth. And that raises a curious question: If you bought one share of Apple at its IPO, how many would you own now? Apple's stock-split history (and IPO price recalculation) Apple's stock has been split five times since going public in December 1980. The first was 1987's 2-for-1 split, followed by another 2-for-1 split in mid-2000. The next split came in early 2005...another 2-for-1 deal. Then the party really started. Following the explosive revenue growth driven by 2007's debut of the iPhone, Apple shares saw a 7-for-1 split in mid-2014 and underwent a 4-for-1 split again in mid-2020. Crunching the numbers, one share of Apple back in 1980 would have become 224 shares today. Adjusting for all of these splits, the stock's IPO price of $22 per share is effectively dialed back to $0.10. Apple is an exception to the norm, but... Apple's is an extremely unusual case, of course. Most stocks don't need to be split as much as this one's been. Nevertheless, not every stock needs to do as well from its inception to make you very, very wealthy. One or two of these mega-winners will do the trick. The challenge is just figuring out which companies have true long-term growth potential and which ones don't. For every winner like Apple, there seems to be a handful of disappointing names like Blue Apron or Groupon . Take your shots, but be discerning and realistic as well. Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?

Berkshire Hathaway purchased more Apple shares in the first quarter, according to a regulatory filing. Its investment is now worth over $50 billion, and received a boost as Apple's market cap crossed the $1 trillion milestone. The conglomerate owned about 246.5 million shares, or about 5.1% of Apple, as of June 30. The share purchases came amid speculation over how Berkshire will deploy a growing mountain of cash. Warren Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway can't seem to get enough of Apple. A regulatory filing released on Saturday showed that the conglomerate added 2.67 million shares to its stake in the first quarter, which was worth nearly $50 billion as of June 30. Berkshire Hathaway owned approximately 246.5 million shares at the time, or 5.1% of the company's outstanding shares. Assuming Berkshire Hathaway hasn't bought or sold more share since then, the stake was worth $51.3 billion in early trading on Monday, making it by far the most valuable slice of any company Buffett is invested in. Buffett's stake certainly received a boost last week as Apple became the first US company to top $1 trillion in market cap . The stock rallied to the magic $207.05 price after Apple beat Wall Street's expectations for second-quarter earnings. Berkshire Hathaway is the third-largest shareholder in Apple, behind Vanguard and BlackRock, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. Earlier this year, Buffett told CNBC that he would \\\"love to own 100 percent\\\" of Apple. He added, \\\"w e like very much the management, and the way they think, and the way they act.\\\" Berkshire first disclosed its stake in the iPhone maker in 2016, and subsequent announcements of more buying have lifted Apple's stock price. Berkshire's additional stake was purchased amid speculation over how the company will use its growing cash pile. Its second-quarter earnings results, also released on Saturday, showed that its cash and cash equivalents swelled to $111.1 billion during the quarter. Buffett said in his most recent shareholder letter that he was eager to make deals, but couldn't find businesses with \\\"sensible\\\" purchase prices. In the interim, Buffett is happy to scoop up more Apple shares.

The article explicitly states that prices are \"outright prices, not adjusted for splits or dividends,\" confirming this figure as the actual price at that time.  Additionally, **Web Page 2 (Macrotrends)** lists Apple’s stock price history, showing that the unadjusted price first exceeded $50 in 2004. Prior to this, the stock had declined to $14.33 by the end of 2002 but rebounded due to product launches like the iPod and iTunes.  The **first year Apple's stock price exceeded $50 was 2004**."

Evaluation of the year [ edit ] The year was greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic , with numerous films originally scheduled for theatrical release postponed or released on video-on-demand or streaming services . However, several film companies stopped reporting box-office numbers during this time due to the COVID-19 pandemic , and several films were still in theaters where guidelines were in place. [ 1 ] As a result, film grosses will increase if they are re-released in the future. This was also the first year since 2007 that no film grossed $1 billion. Highest-grossing films [ edit ] See also: Lists of box office number-one films § 2020 The top films released in 2020 by worldwide gross are as follows: [ 2 ] Highest-grossing films of 2020 [ 3 ] Rank Title Distributor Worldwide gross 1 Demon Slayer The Movie: Mugen Train Toho / Aniplex $507,127,293 [ 4 ] 2 The Eight Hundred CMC Pictures $461,421,559 3 My People, My Homeland China Lion $433,241,288 [ 5 ] 4 Bad Boys for Life Sony $426,505,244 5 Tenet Warner Bros. $365,304,105 6 Sonic the Hedgehog Paramount $319,715,683 7 Dolittle Universal $251,410,631 8 Jiang Ziya Beijing Enlight $243,883,429 9 A Little Red Flower HG Entertainment $238,600,000 [ 6 ] [ 7 ] 10 Shock Wave 2 Universe Films $226,400,000 After being re-released in 4K in China, earning $26.4 million, the overall gross for the 2001 film Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone increased to over $1.008 billion, becoming the 47th film overall and the second billion-dollar film in the Wizarding World franchise, after Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 , at $1.342 billion. 2020 box office records [ edit ] China overtook North America as the world's largest box office market for the first time in 2020. China generated $2.7 billion in theatrical revenue compared to North America's $2.3 billion , the lowest for the North American box office in at least 40 years. [ 8 ] This has been largely attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic , which has had a greater negative impact in North America than in Asia. [ 9 ] Because of the relatively smaller impact of the pandemic on Asian film markets, the majority (6) of the top ten highest-grossing films of the year are East Asian ( Chinese and Japanese ) productions for the first time in history, as the rankings were previously dominated by North American productions . [ 10 ] Film records [ edit ] At the end of 2020, The Eight Hundred became the first Chinese and first non-Hollywood film to top the global box office with more than $450 million in gross. [ 11 ] It was later overtaken by Demon Slayer the Movie: Mugen Train in May 2021. Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Mugen Train , a Japanese anime film based on the manga series Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba , broke a number of box office records. It became the first ever non-Hollywood film production to become the highest-grossing film of the year [ 12 ] and the first 2D-animated feature to become the highest grossing movie of the year since Disney's The Lion King in 1994. It set the all-time box office records for the highest-grossing Japanese film , the highest-grossing anime film , and the highest-grossing R-rated animated film . [ 13 ] In Japan, Mugen Train set the first-day opening record with ¥ 1.2 billion ( $11.3 million ), [ 14 ] before breaking the opening weekend record with ¥4.6 billion ( $43.8 million ) over three days. [ 15 ] It went on to have the highest-grossing second weekend and, in ten days, became the fastest film to cross ¥10 billion ( $96.7 million ), surpassing Spirited Away (2001), which had previously crossed the ¥10 billion milestone in 19 days and held the record for 19 years. [ 16 ] Mugen Train also became the fastest film to cross ¥20 billion in Japan, again faster than Spirited Away . [ 17 ] It also set the record for the highest-grossing IMAX release in Japan, surpassing the previous record holder, Bohemian Rhapsody (2018). [ 18 ] In 59 days, Mugen Train set another record as the fastest film to cross the ¥30 billion milestone, [ 19 ] faster than Spirited Away, which took 253 days to reach the same milestone. [ 20 ] In 66 days, the film set another record as the first film to top the Japanese box office charts for ten straight weekends (since the charts began publication in 2004). [ 21 ] In 73 days, Mugen Train grossed ¥32.48 billion to become the highest-grossing film of all time in Japan , surpassing Spirited Away, which held the record for 19 years. [ 22 ] In Taiwan, Mugen Train grossed NT$ 360 million ( US$12.6 million ) in 17 days, setting the record for the highest-grossing animated film of all time in Taiwan, surpassing the previous record holders Frozen 2 (2019) and Your Name (2016). [ 23 ] [ 24 ] In 20 days, Mugen Train became the first animated film to cross NT$400 million in Taiwan, [ 25 ] before later crossing the NT$500 million milestone. [ 26 ] The film was also the first R-rated film since Die Hard with a Vengeance in 1995 to be the highest-grossing film of the year overall. The film was also the first animated film since The Jungle Book in 1967 to be the highest-grossing film of the year overall and not the highest-grossing animated film of all time at the time. Sonic the Hedgehog broke Pokémon: Detective Pikachu ' s record for the highest opening weekend for a film based on a video game , with $70 million in domestic gross in the United States and Canada. [ 27 ] It went on to become the highest-grossing film based on a video game in the United States and Canada, surpassing Detective Pikachu, although it did not beat it in the worldwide box office.

Pictures (Tenet), Paramount Pictures (Sonic the Hedgehog), Sony Pictures (Bad Boys for Life) In mid-March, the coronavirus pandemic put an immediate halt to the theatrical business, shuttering movie theaters from coast to coast as COVID-19 infections skyrocketed in North America. Though theaters in many areas began slowly opening their doors again, capacity restrictions and widespread uncertainty about the relative safety of the theatrical environment continued to dampen revenue. As a result, our annual look back at the top 10 highest-earning new releases is unusual, to say the least. For comparison’s sake, last year’s top-grossing title, Avengers: Endgame , topped off 2019 with over $858 million in domestic receipts. By contrast, this year’s No. 1, Sony’s Bad Boys for Life, earned less than a quarter of that total. Indeed, only two films – Bad Boys and Sonic the Hedgehog , both released prior to the nationwide shutdown of movie theaters – grossed north of $100 million in 2020, pointing to the devastation wrought by a once-in-a-century pandemic. With widespread vaccinations now on the horizon, we look ahead to a better year as we count down the top 10 box office performers of 2020. Bad Boys for Life $206.31 Million Sony Only in 2020 would a film released in mid-January finish at the top of our yearly ranking. After a nearly 17-year hiatus ( Bad Boys II came out way back in July 2003), the Will Smith-Martin Lawrence buddy threequel Bad Boys for Life proved there was still plenty of juice left in the series when it debuted with a franchise-best $62.5 million 3-day gross over MLK weekend. The leggy title went on to gross $206.31 million domestically and was still in wide release when the pandemic hit. It may have been able to squeeze out a few million more were it not for COVID-19, but Bad Boys for Life had already made the majority of its money by that point, marking it as a rare bright spot in an all-around dismal year at the box office. Sonic the Hedgehog $146.07 Million Paramount Another film released just early enough in the year to qualify as a theatrical success story was Paramount’s Sonic the Hedgehog , the long-in-the-works video game adaptation based on the Sega series of the same name. Released over President’s Day weekend, the $85 million-budgeted film grossed a fantastic $58.02 million over the 3-day period and $70 million over the 4-day span before zooming to $146.07 million by the end of its pandemic-shortened run. Still in over 3,000 locations when the shutdown began, Sonic the Hedgehog was lucky enough to play for a full month before COVID-19 brought moviegoing to an abrupt halt across North America. Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) $84.16 Million Warner Bros. Considered a box office disappointment when it opened to just $33 million in early February, Birds of Prey (later renamed Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey in a futile attempt to salvage the film’s domestic performance) nonetheless lands as the third highest-grossing film in an unprecedented, catastrophic year for North American exhibitors. Truthfully, there wasn’t much gas left in the box office tank for the Suicide Squad spinoff when the pandemic shuttered movie theaters, so its $84.16 million final gross is pretty close to where it would have ended up even without the virus. Dolittle $77.05 Million Universal Universal’s ultra-expensive reimagining of Hugh Lofting’s Doctor Dolittle book series was D.O.A. in North American multiplexes, grossing just $21.84/$28.3 million over MLK weekend against the box office behemoth that was Bad Boys for Life (in what can best be described as a failed bid at counter-programming). Beset by withering reviews, the film tapped out with just $77.05 million in North America and became star Robert Downey Jr.’s latest misfire outside the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Invisible Man $64.91 Million Universal Debuting to a robust $28.21 million over the final weekend of February, Leigh Whannell’s acclaimed reimagining of the nearly century-old horror franchise s\"\n}\n"

Giganotosaurus [ edit ] Nominator(s): FunkMonk ( talk ) 17:10, 30 September 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] This article is about one of the largest known meat-eating dinosaurs, and therefore one of the largest terrestrial carnivores to have ever existed. The dinosaur is thought to have equalled or even surpassed Tyrannosaurus in length, and the article is one of the most viewed dinosaur articles on Wikipedia. The article contains practically everything ever published about this animal, and covers the scientific debate/competition about the maximum size of theropod dinosaurs. The article is a GA and has been copy-edited. FunkMonk ( talk ) 17:10, 30 September 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Comments from Jim [ edit ] Very comprehensive and well written, but, of course, some quibbles I appreciate that there need to be some technical terms, but in places they appear unnecessary. How is \\\"caudal (tail) vertebrae\\\" better than \\\"tail vertebrae\\\" either in style or information content? Please check to see where the text can be made reader-friendlier I swapped the words so the scientific terms for vertebrae are in parenthesis. But for most of the other anatomical terms, the scientific terms are the most used, and using something like \\\"groove\\\" instead of sulcus would be too generic (and make the meaning less clear), I think. FunkMonk ( talk ) 16:14, 3 October 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Similarly, if you are going to use technical or mainly US terms, make sure they are linked. I noticed Vertebra, dune buggy and badlands , but there may be others Linked.

The article was promoted by Ian Rose via FACBot ( talk ) 22:26, 30 November 2016 [1] . After the Deluge (painting) [ edit ] Nominator(s):  ‑ Iridescent 10:42, 13 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] \\\"Bright rising sun illuminating the clouds over a featureless horizon\\\" has become such a staple image since the advent of modern photography, it's easy to forget that it had to begin somewhere. Likewise, if George Frederic Watts is remembered at all nowadays it's as the painter of formal portraits of dignitaries and of earnestly portentious paintings with titles like Love and Death and The Slumber of the Ages , not as the painter of dramatic landscapes. After the Deluge is an explicitly religious painting, yet contains no religious imagery of any kind, and is an interesting snapshot of the transition between 19th-century symbolism and 20th-century abstraction. Because this has spent the last century in the backwater of Compton rather than in a high-profile institution like the Tate Gallery or the Yale Center for British Art, there hasn't been all that much written about this particular piece so the article is shorter than usual, but I believe this collates together everything significant that there is to say about it. And yes, I know it looks like I've accidentally cut-and-pasted a chunk of body text into the wikilink but Light and Colour (Goethe's Theory)—The Morning after the Deluge—Moses Writing the Book of Genesis genuinely is the name of Turner's painting of the same subject. ‑ Iridescent 10:42, 13 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Comments by Lingzhi [ edit ] I'm wondering whether the \\\"A transcendent power of light...\\\" quote would be more appropriate for the \\\"Subject\\\" section... Lingzhi ♦ (talk) 11:31, 13 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] I put it in its current location (about its 1891 exhibition) because Watts didn't include it with either the 1886 exhibition or with its later permanent exhibition in Compton; plus, the \\\"Subject\\\" and \\\"Composition\\\" sections each already include a quotation and I was trying to avoid the appearance of a quotefarm as much as possible. I've no particular attachment to keeping it in any given place, although I feel it makes more sense in the section on exhibition, as it illustrates that Watts was anticipating that his audience wouldn't necessarily get the point if he didn't explain it. ‑ Iridescent 11:46, 13 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Comments by Wehwalt [ edit ] I've got a flight in the morning so forgive me if this is a bit piecemeal: Why is \\\"flood\\\" lower case when appended to \\\"Noah's\\\" but capped otherwise? Because I'm sloppy, now standardized on the capitalized form when talking about the specific Biblical event. ‑ Iridescent 17:15, 13 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] \\\"he explicitly aimed at evoking\\\" this seems too wordy. What's wrong with \\\"he intended to evoke\\\" I've amended it in the lead, but I think the \\\"explicitly\\\" ought to remain in the body. Basically, Watts (along with virtually everyone else at this time) was part of the fad for painting classical subjects and often dabbled with Greek and Roman gods (and \"\n}\n**Web Page 3:**\n{\n  \"id\": 3,\n  \"title\": \"Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Paranthodon/archive1\",\n  \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Paranthodon/archive1\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"This article is about the dinosaur genus Paranthodon, arguably one of the most obscure dinosaurs, with the only bone known being part of a skull originally ...\",\n  \"context\": \"Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Paranthodon/archive1 - Wikipedia Jump to content Main menu Main menu move to sidebar hide Navigation Main page Contents Current events Random article About Wikipedia Contact us Contribute Help Learn to edit Community portal Recent changes Upload file Special pages Search Search Appearance Donate Create account Log in Personal tools Donate Create account Log in Pages for logged out editors learn more Contributions Talk Contents move to sidebar hide (Top) 1 Paranthodon Toggle Paranthodon subsection 1.1 Support and comment from Jim 1.2 Support Comment from Cas Liber 1.3 Source review from Cas Liber 1.4 Image review from RL0919 1.5 Support from Firsfron Toggle the table of contents Wikipedia : Featured article candidates/Paranthodon/archive1 Add languages Add links Project page Talk English Read Edit View history Tools Tools move to sidebar hide Actions Read Edit View history General What links here Related changes Upload file Permanent link Page information Get shortened URL Download QR code Print/export Download as PDF Printable version In other projects Appearance move to sidebar hide From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia < Wikipedia:Featured article candidates The following is an archived discussion of a featured article nomination .

The article was promoted by Sarastro1 via FACBot ( talk ) 21:53, 13 January 2017 [1] . Paranthodon [ edit ] Nominator(s): IJReid discuss 02:25, 27 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] This article is about the dinosaur genus Paranthodon , arguably one of the most obscure dinosaurs, with the only bone known being part of a skull originally identified as a pareiasaur. From what I can tell with a simple Google Scholar search, every verifiable publication on the taxon has been included at some point, as well as most sources mentioning the taxon. While being fully comprehensive, this article has remained quite short due to lack of literature. No major changes should come anytime soon, as in a short email conversation with palaeontologist Susannah Maidment (several of her publications are referenced here), it was brought up that an project on the taxon was going to be started by one of her students, but that she didn't expect anything on the taxon to change. This article has been copy edited, and is as comprehensive as it can be with the current literature, and that is why I am nominating it for FA. IJReid discuss 02:25, 27 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Comments . As always, feel free to revert my copyediting. - Dank ( push to talk ) There are 3 instances of \\\"however\\\" in the Classification section; see if you can trim one or two of them.

These are my edits. - Dank ( push to talk ) 01:34, 28 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Wow thanks for the support! I see nothing wrong with your edits, every little fix helps. IJReid discuss 03:14, 28 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Since I GA reviewed this, and have drawn one of the images in the article, I'll wait doing a review/support after some more uninvolved users have left their comments. But two image things that could be done is to link and attribute the base map this map was cropped from [2] on the file description, and add the source for the size given in this size estimate [3] in the file description there. FunkMonk ( talk ) 21:20, 29 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Both are done. For the first image, the base was already in the description, so I added it under Other Versions as the base map. However, I am considering using the base .svg instead, with a locator to indicate where the formation is (if I figure out how to add the red dot things). IJReid discuss 02:36, 30 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Nice, then that at least won't be a problem during the image review. FunkMonk ( talk ) 09:14, 30 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Support - with the caveat that I GA reviewed the article. This article proves that comprehensive and interesting accounts can be written about obscure dinosaurs known from very little material (most of our other dinosaur FAs are about much more completely known and famous animals). FunkMonk ( talk ) 18:04, 14 December 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Support and comment from Jim [ edit ] I'm happy to support this well-written article, just one minor point though. In the body of the text, when you name a person you put, for example, British paleontologist Richard Owen . Wouldn't it be more helpful to put this fuller description at the first mention instead of just \\\"Owen\\\"?

Painting by Franz Rösel von Rosenhof, public domain/CC0. When I was a child, I had a scrapbook which I filled with pictures of extinct animals, especially dinosaurs. As I was unable to write myself, I asked my mom to copy text from some of my books on the subject, to make the scrapbook look more “real”. I was fascinated by extinct animals, since no one had ever seen them alive, making them almost mythological. I later began drawing my own illustrations of extinct creatures, but by the time I reached my teens, this felt like an “uncool” waste of time. Fast forward to my early twenties, when I began to casually edit Wikipedia articles, and became very impressed by the dinosaur articles there. I discovered that due to Wikipedia’s license policies , many dinosaur articles lacked illustrations, and this rekindled my interest in drawing dinosaurs: now there was a purpose to it! I started posting illustrations to WikiProject Dinosaurs’ image review page , where I got a crash-course in the latest dinosaur research by the local experts. I was surprised by the discoveries that had been made since I stopped paying attention to the field, but I did not feel confident enough in my knowledge to edit the article texts, so I stuck to adding illustrations and photographs, some self-made, and some “scavenged” on the web. One amusing consequence of making free illustrations for Wikipedia was seeing them pop up in unexpected places. I recognised an illustration I made of the dinosaur Segnosaurus on a bootleg poster sold outside a Walking With Dinosaurs arena show, and noticed the same illustration in an exhibit at a Polish museum… Early illustration I made for Wikipedia of Segnosaurus , which popped up on a bootleg poster and in a Polish museum. Restoration by FunkMonk, CC BY-SA 3.0 . As the years went, I became increasingly familiar with the palaeontological literature through my activities on Wikipedia. I started buying books about dinosaurs and other extinct animals again, and I reached a point where I was able to identify unlabelled photos of museum specimens in free Flickr and Wikimedia Commons images, thereby making them useful for Wikipedia. Among the new books I had acquired was one about the extinct dodo . Looking at the bird’s Wikipedia article, I was baffled by the state it was in, considering how famous a species it was. To flesh out the article, I added a few 17th century quotes from travellers who encountered the bird, but the text still didn’t feel worthy of the subject. The following summer, my girlfriend and I broke up, and my holiday plans went out the window. With nothing specific to do, I took a crack at summarising text from my dodo book in the Wikipedia article, mainly to make room for some interesting contemporary illustrations of the bird. After some days I was hooked, and I started to do the same in the article about the related and also extinct Rodrigues solitaire . After having expanded these articles, I got curious about nominating them for good and perhaps featured article status, but as a non-native speaker, I was unsure about the quality of my English writing. With support from editors at WikiProject Birds , the articles were promoted, and I felt encouraged to expand and nominate more articles about recently extinct birds—an otherwise quite neglected subject on Wikipedia, with only two prior featured articles, but also one where sources were easy to come by. After some months, I had successfully nominated articles about most of the charismatic extinct bird fauna of the Mascarene islands, and I then began working my way towards other extinct animals, began co-writing articles with other editors, and finally felt confident enough in my writing to tackle dinosaur articles. I had felt uneasy with this subject because of the great work that had been done before me, so I started with Dromaeosauroides , a rat\"\n}\n**Web Page 5:**\n{\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"title\": \"Wikipedia:Featured articles promoted in 2016\",\n  \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_articles_promoted_in_2016\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Promoted in November 2016 ; Turbinellus floccosus, December 31, 2019, Casliber ; Northampton War Memorial, November 11, 2019, HJ Mitchell ; Giganotosaurus, July 30 ...\",\n  \"context\": \"Wikipedia:Featured articles promoted in 2016 - Wikipedia Jump to content Main menu Main menu move to sidebar hide Navigation Main page Contents Current events Random article About Wikipedia Contact us Contribute Help Learn to edit Community portal Recent changes Upload file Special pages Search Search Appearance Donate Create account Log in Personal tools Donate Create account Log in Pages for logged out editors learn more Contributions Talk Contents move to sidebar hide (Top) 1 Promoted in December 2016 2 Promoted in November 2016 3 Promoted in October 2016 4 Promoted in September 2016 5 Promoted in August 2016 6 Promoted in July 2016 7 Promoted in June 2016 8 Promoted in May 2016 9 Promoted in April 2016 10 Promoted in March 2016 11 Promoted in February 2016 12 Promoted in January 2016 Toggle the table of contents Wikipedia : Featured articles promoted in 2016 2 languages Русский 粵語 Edit links Project page Talk English Read Edit View history Tools Tools move to sidebar hide Actions Read Edit View history General What links here Related changes Upload file Permanent link Page information Get shortened URL Download QR code Print/export Download as PDF Printable version In other projects Wikidata item Appearance move to sidebar hide From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia < 2015 2017 > Shortcut WP:FA2016 WP:FA2016 This page is the list of featured articles that were promoted in 2016, listed by the month in which they were promoted.

Level 2: More complex reasoning, 5–10 steps, coordination between multiple tools. Level 3: Long-term planning and advanced tool integration. The GAIA benchmark used by Hugging Face is a practical subset of the full GAIA benchmark because the course uses 20 questions drawn from Level 1 of the GAIA validation set. These questions are filtered to require a manageable number of steps and tools, making them suitable for students building their first agents. The benchmark is used as the final hands-on project in the course: students must build an agent, submit its answers to these 20 questions, and achieve a score of at least 30% to earn the course certificate. Let’s examine a typical GAIA question (not included in the sample): “Which of the fruits shown in the 2008 painting ‘Embroidery from Uzbekistan’ were served as part of the October 1949 breakfast menu for the ocean liner that was later used as a floating prop for the film ‘The Last Voyage’? Give the items as a comma-separated list, ordering them in clockwise order based on their arrangement in the painting starting from the 12 o’clock position. Use the plural form of each fruit.” This question requires: Multimodal reasoning (in this case analyzing an image is crucial) Multi-hop retrieval (you need to connect facts across several sources to reach an answer) Structured response formatting (e.g., a comma-separated list, specific ordering, using plural forms of nouns) High-level planning and sequencing Hence, one can understand how these kinds of questions can challenge an LLM’s capabilities to plan and, ultimately, to structure reasoning directed towards an objective. My analysis, while not conclusive, aims to offer a glance at Gemini 2.5’s reasoning capabilities and highlight the difficulty in distinguishing between a generative stochastic process that connects dots (a somewhat reductive, though common, view of LLMs) and truly logical, structured reasoning. Even if one cannot empirically resolve this Gordian knot of LLM reasoning, the effectiveness of the process in certain contexts can be observed. In my analysis, I will take three tasks from the HF benchmark as examples and discuss the planning involved and its execution. The following sections will examine these examples. Let’s start! Before starting, here are some technical details. The used prompt has been: You are a reasoning AI assistant capable of using multiple tools and web searches. I will ask you a question. Report your thoughts, and finish your answer with the following template: FINAL ANSWER: [YOUR FINAL ANSWER\\\\]. YOUR FINAL ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings. If you are asked for a number, don’t use comma to write your number neither use units such as $ or percent sign unless specified otherwise. If you are asked for a string, don’t use articles, neither abbreviations (e.g. for cities), and write the digits in plain text unless specified otherwise. If you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending of whether the element to be put in the list is a number or a string. The code, since the competition is based on Hugging Face infrastructure, is based on Hugging Face smolagents ( https://smolagents.org/ https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents ). You can find the used functions to be called at https://gist.github.com/lmassaron/475d8dad80a0b155f652cabbad872409 All these functions have been vibe-coded using Gemini 2.5 Pro itself. The first planning and reasoning trace is: “.rewsna eht sa “tfel” drow eht fo etisoppo eht etirw ,ecnetnes siht dnatsrednu uoy fI” Basically, it is the reversed sentence: “If you understand this sentence, write the opposite of the word 'left' as the answer.” Here are the facts I know and the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task: ``` ## 1.

Do not edit the contents of this page. If you wish to start a new discussion or revive an old one, please do so on the current talk page . We are losing content editors Within the past 48 hours three of our most prolific featured writers – User: Tim riley , User:SchroCat and User:Cassianto , with around 70 FAs between them, have either left Wikipedia or have signalled their imminent intent to do so. They were also regular FAC reviewers, apart from their involvement in other aspects of the encyclopaedia. Their departure is a huge blow to the FAC process. The immediate cause of their departure appears to be   frustration and despair  at the machinations within the ongoing infobox dicussions on the Noel Coward talkpage, but there's more to it than that. These three, and their articles in the music and performing arts fields, have been regularly targeted over the years by editors, not always the same ones, pushing a pro-infobox agenda against their individual and collective conviction that such boxes are not always necessary or advantageous – a position upheld many times in the FAC process. It is worth noting that there are many featured articles in fields other than music/p.a., that do not bear infoboxes and which never receive any attention from the infobox lobby – they always turn to the work of these three or their co-writers such as myself. As if enough wasn't enough, the \\\"curators\\\" of the encyclopaedia have opened up a new line of attack, this time against editors' liberal interpretation of MoS with regard to quote boxes. This usage is, again, widespread and features in many FAs. But guess where the curators have focussed their attentions? Here it is : make what you will of it. More walkouts may be confidently predicted, if this is the atmosphere in which content editors  are required to work. Brianboulton ( talk ) 15:35, 2 September 2016 (UTC) For me, although the Coward thread (and its flawed and biased early RfC close) and the ongoing silliness over IBs is deeply depressing and eroding of enjoyment, it's having to deal with the wall-of-text MoS fetishists, so desperate to prove themselves capable of something that is utterly divisive and ridiculous. There are people so intent on controlling the MoS to their own narrow POV (normally driven from an American style guide) that were the ultimate killers of any enthusiasm I had for the project. A couple of very small groups—one IB related, one MoS related—are targeting the work of a very small number. It's odd that with over 5.2 million articles on Wiki, most of which are in dire need of bringing up to a basic standard, these two groups manage to go feral on the FAs (that is, the articles that have been through two community review processes, are written to high standards, and use professional levels of English in their production. I am not sure if, for example, the MoS merchants understand the difference between their own levels of use and formal English, or whether they just don't care and want to ensure a bland level of 'passable b\"\n}\n"

Supporters of the cause expressed their sentiments in a music-hall ditty with this refrain: We don’t want to fight, yet by jingo if we do, We’ve got the ships, we’ve got the men, We’ve got the money, too! Someone holding the attitude implied in the song became known as a jingo or jingoist , and the attitude itself was dubbed jingoism . The jingo in the tune is probably a euphemism for Jesus .

The objective of the online word game is to guess a secret five-letter word in six tries or less, using a series of guesses to figure it out. Once you guess a word, if any of the letters in that word appear highlighted in green, it means that letter is in the right place. If any of the letters are highlighted yellow, that letter is in the word, but it’s in the wrong space. If one of your letters is highlighted in gray, it means that letter isn’t included anywhere in the puzzle. Here’s a hint to Monday’s Wordle: The word is used to describe something as old — particularly old clothes. The word of the day also contains two vowels. *Warning: Spoiler below* Wordle has been purchased by the New York Times. The Wordle answer for June 27 is “RETRO.” According to the Merriam-Webster , retro means “relating to, reviving, or being the styles and especially the fashions of the past: fashionably nostalgic or old-fashioned.” Wordle’s word of the day for Saturday was “BEADY” and Sunday’s was “RUSTY.” Wordle releases a new word of the day every day. Players must wait until midnight for a new word of the day and can only play once a day.

See the entry >              Examples:     âNilssonâs reputation preceded her. The New York Times wrote of her: âChristine Nilsson, the Metâs first diva in 1883, could not only stipulate by contract her choice of roles, but could prohibit their performance by any other soprano in the same season.ââ â Elise Taylor and Stephanie Sporn, Vogue, 20 June 2025              Did you know?     Like many terms used in the legal profession, stipulate, an English word since the 17th century, has its roots in Latin. It comes from stipulatus, the past participle of stipulari, a verb meaning âto demand a guarantee (from a prospective debtor).â In Roman law, oral contracts were deemed valid only if they followed a proper question-and-answer format; stipulate was sometimes used specifically of this same process of contract making, though it also could be used more generally for any means of making a contract or agreement. The âto specify as a condition or requirementâ meaning of stipulate also dates to the 17th century, and is the sense of the word most often encountered today. 2 min 2 DAYS AGO hidebound Merriam-Webster's Word of the Day for August 10, 2025 is:                   hidebound Â \\\\HYDE-bound\\\\  Â adjective     Someone or something described as hidebound is inflexible and unwilling to accept new or different ideas. // Although somewhat stuffy and strict, the professor did not so completely adhere to hidebound academic tradition that he wouldnât teach class outside on an especially lovely day. See the entry >              Examples:     âHe was exciting then, different from all the physicists I worked with in the way that he was so broadly educated and interested, not hidebound and literal, as my colleagues were.â â Joe Mungo Reed, Terrestrial History: A Novel, 2025              Did you know?     Hidebound has its origins in agriculture. The adjective, which appeared in English in the early 17th century, originally described cattle whose skin, due to illness or poor feeding, clung to the skeleton and could not be pinched, loosened, or worked with the fingers (the adjective followed an earlier noun form referring to this condition). Hidebound was applied to humans too, to describe people afflicted with tight skin. Figurative use quickly followed, first with a meaning of âstingyâ or âmiserly.â That sense has since fallen out of use, but a second figurative usage, describing people who are rigid or unyielding in their actions or beliefs, lives on in our language today. 2 min 3 DAYS AGO behemoth Merriam-Webster's Word of the Day for August 9, 2025 is:                   behemoth Â \\\\bih-HEE-muth\\\\  Â noun     A behemoth is something of monstrous size, power, or appearance.

Read on for what it means, how it’s used, and more. And to those that celebrate, Happy Easter! What It Means Resurrection can mean “resurgence” or “revival.” In Christian theology it is often associated with the rising of Christ from the dead. // The community applauded the resurrection of the commuter rail system. RESURRECTION in Context “In Egyptian mythology the phoenix perished on a pyre every five hundred years and then rose rejuvenated from the ashes. Hence the early Christians adopted the phoenix as a symbol of Christ’s resurrection .” — Rev. Thomas L. Sheridan, quoted in The Lexington (Kentucky) Herald Leader , 17 Mar. 2022 Did You Know? Resurrection comes from Anglo-French resurreccioun . Originally, the word was used in Christian contexts to refer to the rising of Christ from the dead or to the festival celebrating this rising (now known as Easter ). The word eventually began to be used more generally in the senses of “resurgence” or “revival.” Its Latin root, surgere , means “to rise.” As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.

Authentic voice. Authentic self. Authenticity as artifice. Lookups for the word are routinely heavy on the dictionary company's site but were boosted to new heights throughout the year, editor at large Peter Sokolowski told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview. “We see in 2023 a kind of crisis of authenticity,” he said ahead of Monday's announcement of this year's word. “What we realize is that when we question authenticity, we value it even more.” Sokolowski and his team don't delve into the reasons people head for dictionaries and websites in search of specific words. Rather, they chase the data on lookup spikes and world events that correlate. This time around, there was no particularly huge boost at any given time but a constancy to the increased interest in “authentic.” This was the year of artificial intelligence, for sure, but also a moment when ChatGPT-maker OpenAI suffered a leadership crisis. Taylor Swift and Prince Harry chased after authenticity in their words and deeds. Musk himself, at February's World Government Summit in Dubai, urged the heads of companies, politicians, ministers and other leaders to “speak authentically” on social media by running their own accounts. “Can we trust whether a student wrote this paper? Can we trust whether a politician made this statement? We don't always trust what we see anymore,” Sokolowski said. “We sometimes don't believe our own eyes or our own ears. We are now recognizing that authenticity is a performance itself.\\\" Merriam-Webster's entry for “authentic” is busy with meaning . There's “not false or imitation: real, actual,” as in an authentic cockney accent. There's “true to one's own personality, spirit or character.” There's “worthy of acceptance or belief as conforming to or based on fact.” There's “made or done the same way as an original.” And, perhaps the most telling, there's “conforming to an original so as to reproduce essential features.” “Authentic” follows 2022’s choice of “gaslighting.” And 2023 marks Merriam-Webster’s 20th anniversary choosing a top word. The company’s data crunchers filter out evergreen words like “love” and “affect” vs. “effect” that are always high in lookups among the 500,000 words it defines online. This year, the wordsmiths also filtered out numerous five-letter words because Wordle and Quordle players clearly use the company’s site in search of them as they play the daily games, Sokolowski said. Sokolowski, a lexicologist, and his colleagues have a bevy of runners-up for word of the year that also attracted unusual traffic. They include “X” (lookups spiked in July after Musk's rebranding of Twitter), “EGOT” (there was a boost in February when Viola Davis achieved that rare quadruple-award status with a Grammy) and “Elemental,” the title of a new Pixar film that had lookups jumping in June. Rounding out the company's top words of 2023, in no particular order: RIZZ: It's slang for “romantic appeal or charm\\\" and seemingly short for charisma. Merri\"\n}\n"

        "turn_1_webpage_analyses": "The Merriam-Webster Word of the Day on June 27, 2022, was **\"jingoism\"**. According to the dictionary's entry, **jingoism** is defined as \"excessive patriotism or nationalism, especially when marked by a belligerent foreign policy.\" The word originated during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, as explained in the context provided by Merriam-Webster, when British supporters of intervention expressed their stance through a music-hall song containing the refrain: *\"We don't want to fight, yet by jingo if we do, We've got the ships, we've got the men, We've got the money, too!\"* The term itself likely derives from a euphemism for \"Jesus\" used in the song.  This information is confirmed by **Web Page 1**, **Web Page 2**, and **Web Page 5**, which explicitly state the date and definition, while the historical context is directly quoted from Merriam-Webster's own content.

The 2023 IPCC report has a specific version that is 85 pages long, and we need to find out how many of these pages mention nuclear energy.\n\nHowever, the question does not provide any direct information about the content of the report, and we don't have the actual report to check. To get accurate information, we would need to search for details about the content of this specific version of the report.\n\nLet's perform a search to find more information about the 2023 IPCC report and its content.\n\n<|begin_search_query|> content of the 2023 IPCC report 85 pages version <|end_search_query|>\n\n<|begin_search_result|>The 85-page version of the 2023 IPCC Synthesis Report (referred to as the \"Longer Report\") synthesizes findings from the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) and focuses on three key sections:  1. **Current Status and Trends**: Discusses observed climate changes, historical drivers (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions), and current adaptation/mitigation efforts.  2. **Long-Term Climate and Development Futures**: Assesses projected climate impacts up to 2100 and beyond, emphasizing the need for rapid emissions reductions to limit warming to 1.5°C.  3. **Near-Term Responses**: Highlights opportunities for scaling climate action by 2040, emphasizing equity, justice, and sustainable development pathways.  The report explicitly states that:  - Human-induced warming has already reached **1.1°C**, with a \"very likely\" exceedance of 1.5°C within decades.  - **Nuclear energy** is not explicitly mentioned in the provided snippets of the Longer Report (Web Pages 5, 6, 7). The content focuses on renewable energy, energy efficiency, and carbon removal strategies instead.  The **Summary for Policymakers (34 pages)** and **Full Volume (184 pages)** also do not mention nuclear energy in the available excerpts (Web Pages 1, 3, 4, 9). The 85-page Longer Report appears to prioritize discussions of mitigation pathways like renewables, energy transitions, and ecosystem conservation over nuclear energy.  **Implication for the Original Question**:  Since the provided sources do not reference nuclear energy in the 85-page Longer Report, the exact number of pages mentioning it cannot be determined from the available information. To answer the original question definitively, direct access to the full text of the 85-page version would be required.<|end_search_result|>\n\n",

The Panel at its 46th Session held from 6 to 10 September 2017 in Montreal, Canada, took note of document IPCC-XLVI/Doc.6 which was produced during the scoping meeting. A dedicated Scoping meeting for the AR6 Synthesis Report was held in Singapore from 21 to 23 October 2019, the outcome of which is included in the AR6 SYR Scoping document IPCC-LII/Doc.10 submitted to the 52nd session of the Panel. It is explained in more detail in the information document IPCC-LII/INF.12 . The Panel at its 52nd Session held in Paris, France from 24 to 28 February 2020 agreed to the outline of the AR6 SYR as is contained in Annex 1 to Decision IPCC-LII-10. The Synthesis Report Outline The SYR outline agreed at the 52 nd Panel Session of the IPCC consists of an introduction and three main sections arranged by timeframes. The first section, ‘Current Status and Trends’, covers the historical and present period. The second section, ‘Long-term Climate and Development Futures’, addresses projected futures up to 2100 and beyond. The final section is ‘Near-term Responses in a Changing Climate’, considers current international policy timeframes, and the time interval between now and 2030-2040. This structure, substantially different to what was adopted for AR5 SYR, enables a holistic framing that integrates across the Working Groups, better enabling the SYR to cover different aspects of climate change.

It recognizes the interdependence of climate, ecosystems and biodiversity, and human societies; the value of diverse forms of knowledge; and the close linkages between climate change adaptation, mitigation, ecosystem health, human well-being and sustainable development. Building on multiple analytical frameworks, including those from the physical and social sciences, this report identifies opportunities for transformative action which are effective, feasible, just and equitable using concepts of systems transitions and resilient development pathways60. Different regional classification schemes61 are used for physical, social and economic aspects, reflecting the underlying literature. After this introduction, Section 2, ‘Current Status and Trends’, opens with the assessment of observational evidence for our changing climate, historical and current drivers of human-induced climate change, and its impacts. It assesses the current implementation of adaptation and mitigation response options.

Here are their stories. It's Earth Month—a time to raise awareness and incite action around the issues affecting our planet amidst the climate crisis. It is also a time to reflect on our relationship with Earth and how humanity can and must do better when it comes to how we treat our planet. So let's face the truth together and talk about the latest climate discoveries released that have been raising a lot of questions about the future of our home we call Earth: the newest IPCC Assessment Report on Climate Change. What is the \\\"IPCC\\\"? The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the United Nations body consisting of thousands of the world's top climate scientists and advisors, who are charged with the global responsibility to assess and advance scientific knowledge about human-induced climate change. (Yes, the climate crisis is primarily caused by humans.) Why is the report important? View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sustainable Ocean Alliance (@soalliance) Officially known as the Synthesis Report of the IPCC Sixth Assessment (or \\\"AR6\\\"), this comprehensive report summarizes more than five years of data and research on the current state of climate change, the resulting risks and impacts, and how we can mitigate and adapt to our changing climate for a better future. This report is being called a \\\"final warning\\\" from the IPCC for humanity to make the drastic and necessary changes in order to avoid irreversible damage to our planet. In addition to sharing the losses and risks, the IPCC has also shared pathways for a sustainable future. With 85 dense pages of information, there is a lot to digest with AR6 . To save you some time, Sustainable Ocean Alliance has pulled the top takeaways you should know about this report in regard to our warming planet and ocean. The Top Challenges : 1.  Right now, our current pace of action is NOT sufficient to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Our planet has already warmed 1.2º Celsius above preindustrial levels, due mainly to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, global pollution, and more. Global goals have set 1.5ºC of warming as the upper limit before we risk the chance of putting all species (including humans) in jeopardy. See Figure 2.1: The causal chain from emissions to resulting warming of the climate system. 2. We have already spent about 80% of the total carbon budget set in order to limit global warming to 1.5°C , meaning it is \\\"very likely\\\" that we will exceed 1.5ºC of global warming in the next 10 years (with the risk of reaching 5ºC by the end of THIS century). See Figure 3.5: Cumulative past, projected, and committed emissions, and associated global temperature changes. 3. Global warming will continue to increase in the near future, mainly due to rising carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions . With every additional increment of global warming, changes in extremes continue to become larger, more complex, and harder to manage. See Figure 4.3: Every region faces more severe or frequent compound and/or cascading climate risks in the near term. 4. Widespread and rapid changes in the ocean and atmosphere have already occurred. We have seen this with the many weather and climate extremes such as heatwaves, heavy storms, droughts, and cyclones affecting every region and ecosystem across the globe—impacting vulnerable frontline communities first. 5. Sea levels have risen by 8 inches since preindustrial times and will be unavoidable for centuries (possibly even millennia) due to deep ocean warming and sea ice melt, and sea levels will remain elevated for THOUSANDS of years. The IPCC states that \\\"human influence is very likely the main driver of these increases.\\\" However, rapid reductions in GHG emissions would limit further sea level rise acceleration and projected long-term sea level rise commitment. See Figure 3.4: Observed and projected global mean sea level change and its impacts, and time scales of coastal risk management. 6. Ocean warming and acidification have adversely affected food security for fisheries and aquaculture in many regions. Nearly 90% of the world's fisheries are already exploited or in a state of collapse . 7.

Drawing on the findings of 234 scientists on the physical science of climate change , 270 scientists on impacts, adaptation and vulnerability to climate change , and 278 scientists on climate change mitigation , this IPCC synthesis report provides the most comprehensive, best available scientific assessment of climate change. It also makes for grim reading. Across nearly 8,000 pages, the AR6 details the devastating consequences of rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions around the world — the destruction of homes, the loss of livelihoods and the fragmentation of communities, for example — as well as the increasingly dangerous and irreversible risks should we fail to change course. But the IPCC also offers hope, highlighting pathways to avoid these intensifying risks. It identifies readily available, and in some cases, highly cost-effective actions that can be undertaken now to reduce GHG emissions, scale up carbon removal and build resilience. While the window to address the climate crisis is rapidly closing, the IPCC affirms that we can still secure a safe, livable future. Here are 10 key findings you need to know: 1. Human-induced global warming of 1.1 degrees C has spurred changes to the Earth’s climate that are unprecedented in recent human history. Already, with 1.1 degrees C (2 degrees F) of global temperature rise, changes to the climate system that are unparalleled over centuries to millennia are now occurring in every region of the world, from rising sea levels to more extreme weather events to rapidly disappearing sea ice. Additional warming will increase the magnitude of these changes. Every 0.5 degree C (0.9 degrees F) of global temperature rise, for example, will cause clearly discernible increases in the frequency and severity of heat extremes, heavy rainfall events and regional droughts. Similarly, heatwaves that, on average, arose once every 10 years in a climate with little human influence will likely occur 4.1 times more frequently with 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) of warming, 5.6 times with 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) and 9.4 times with 4 degrees C (7.2 degrees F) — and the intensity of these heatwaves will also increase by 1.9 degrees C (3.4 degrees F), 2.6 degrees C (4.7 degrees F) and 5.1 degrees C (9.2 degrees F) respectively. Rising global temperatures also heighten the probability of reaching dangerous tipping points in the climate system that, once crossed, can trigger self-amplifying feedbacks that further increase global warming, such as thawing permafrost or massive forest dieback. Setting such reinforcing feedbacks in motion can also lead to other substantial, abrupt and irreversible changes to the climate system. Should warming reach between 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) and 3 degrees C (5.4 degrees F), for example, the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets could melt almost completely and irreversibly over many thousands of years, causing sea levels to rise by several meters. 2. Climate impacts on people and ecosystems are more widespread and severe than expected, and future risks will escalate rapidly with every fraction of a degree of warming. Described as an “an atlas of human suffering and a damning indictment of failed climate leadership” by United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, one of AR6’s most alarming conclusions is that adverse climate impacts are already more far-reaching and extreme than anticipated. About half of the global population currently contends with severe water scarcity for at least one month per year, while higher temperatures are enabling the spread of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, West Nile virus and Lyme disease.

        "turn_1_webpage_analyses": "The 85-page version of the 2023 IPCC Synthesis Report (referred to as the \"Longer Report\") synthesizes findings from the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) and focuses on three key sections:  1. **Current Status and Trends**: Discusses observed climate changes, historical drivers (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions), and current adaptation/mitigation efforts.  2. **Long-Term Climate and Development Futures**: Assesses projected climate impacts up to 2100 and beyond, emphasizing the need for rapid emissions reductions to limit warming to 1.5°C.  3. **Near-Term Responses**: Highlights opportunities for scaling climate action by 2040, emphasizing equity, justice, and sustainable development pathways.  The report explicitly states that:  - Human-induced warming has already reached **1.1°C**, with a \"very likely\" exceedance of 1.5°C within decades.  - **Nuclear energy** is not explicitly mentioned in the provided snippets of the Longer Report (Web Pages 5, 6, 7). The content focuses on renewable energy, energy efficiency, and carbon removal strategies instead.  The **Summary for Policymakers (34 pages)** and **Full Volume (184 pages)** also do not mention nuclear energy in the available excerpts (Web Pages 1, 3, 4, 9). The 85-page Longer Report appears to prioritize discussions of mitigation pathways like renewables, energy transitions, and ecosystem conservation over nuclear energy.  **Implication for the Original Question**:  Since the provided sources do not reference nuclear energy in the 85-page Longer Report, the exact number of pages mentioning it cannot be determined from the available information. To answer the original question definitively, direct access to the full text of the 85-page version would be required."

Rather than using alternate weights of 1 and 3, the checksum digit is calculated with an alternate weight of 1 and some other positive integer less than 10. Otherwise, the checksum digit is calculated as expected. Unfortunately, there is an error in the data. Two adjacent columns have been transposed. These errored columns do not involve the final column or one of the first three columns. Using this information, please provide all potential solutions with the unknown weight and the smaller index of the two errored columns (assume we start our indexing at 0 and ignore hyphens).

A total of 78 episodes were produced and broadcast on Treehouse TV . [ 2 ] Characters [ edit ] This section's tone or style may not reflect the encyclopedic tone used on Wikipedia . See Wikipedia's guide to writing better articles for suggestions. ( February 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Frank Meschkuleit acts as the narrator and performs character voices. Dragon is the title character of the show, a friendly-naive dragon (a wingless dragon—resembling a dinosaur ). Dragon giggles his way through life. No matter what happens, this jolly hero's glass is always half-full. Slightly awkward, with a giant toothy grin, Dragon is curious about everything and will follow his nose wherever it may lead him. Happy and helpful, he is always ready to lend a hand. Even when things get messy, Dragon plays it cool. If you take life one step a time, there's nothing to be afraid of. Nothing at all. He's very creative and has many new things that come to mind he would plan for himself and all his friends who love him. Cat is Dragon's cat . Unlike Dragon's other anthropomorphic friends, Cat is really just a typical cat. Dropping in from time to time, Cat will happily accompany Dragon for a while. But she'll only stick around as long as she's interested. And then, she's off in search of her own adventures. Satisfied and self-absorbed, Cat is highly fussy about her meals! She's not too concerned about the world around her and she loves to stretch out for long naps. Beaver is a busy and curious beaver . Beaver likes to keep busy. Most of the time, he's doing chores and rebuilding his home while he mutters and grumbles to himself. He repeats \\\"Yes\\\" and \\\"No\\\" a lot possibly because of his personality. For Beaver, life is no picnic. Beaver is always looking for a better and faster way of getting things done. Unfortunately, Beaver's shoddy workmanship usually has him working overtime. Curious and cantankerous, Beaver is constantly pondering how and why things are done the way they are. Mail Mouse is a mouse who is reliable and is bold. Mail Mouse loves her job and she's shown to be good at it. Sometimes, she hand delivers the mail, and at other times, she just leaves it at the mailbox. Either way, she's quick, reliable and a lot of fun. Opinionated and always willing to lend a helping hand, Mail Mouse is generous with her advice. She's bold without being pushy and that's just the way the others like her. Ostrich is an ostrich who runs a general store. Ostrich is a strange and wonderful bird. Ostrich is always busy with something. She has a head for business and manages her own general store. She can also be seen tidying the streets and clocking time as the village's physician. Ostrich tries very hard to be a superhero, and she is determined to rescue people, whether or not they need to be rescued. She has even developed her very own superhero yodel and dance. Alligator is a kooky and creative alligator . Alligator never worries about finding a solution\"\n}\n**Web Page 2:**\n{\n  \"id\": 2,\n  \"title\": \"Dragon (magazine) - Wikipedia\",\n  \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_(magazine)\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"They removed the word \\\"magazine\\\" from the cover title ... From the magazine's beginning until issue 274, from August 2000, Dragon published articles ...\",\n  \"context\": \" last print issue shipped in mid-August 2007, Wizards of the Coast (part of Hasbro, Inc. ), the publication's current copyright holder, relaunched Dragon as an online magazine , continuing on the numbering of the print edition. The last published issue was No. 430 in December 2013. A digital publication called Dragon+ , which replaced Dragon magazine, was launched in 2015. [ 3 ] It was created by the advertising agency Dialect in collaboration with Wizards of the Coast, and its numbering system for issues started at No. 1. [ 4 ] History [ edit ] TSR [ edit ] In 1975, TSR, Inc. began publishing The Strategic Review . At the time, roleplaying games were still seen as a subgenre of the wargaming industry, and the magazine was designed not only to support Dungeons & Dragons and TSR's other games, but also to cover wargaming in general. In short order, however, the popularity and growth of Dungeons & Dragons made it clear that the game had not only separated itself from its wargaming origins, but had launched an entirely new industry unto itself. TSR canceled The Strategic Review the following year after only seven issues, and replaced it with two magazines, Little Wars , which covered miniature wargaming , and The Dragon , which covered role playing games.  After twelve issues, Little Wars ceased independent publication and issue 13 was published as part of Dragon issue 22. [ 5 ] The magazine debuted as The Dragon in June 1976. [ 6 ] TSR co-founder Gary Gygax commented years later: \\\"When I decided that The Strategic Review was not the right vehicle, hired Tim Kask as a magazine editor for Tactical Studies Rules, and named the new publication he was to produce The Dragon , I thought we would eventually have a great periodical to serve gaming enthusiasts worldwide... At no time did I ever contemplate so great a success or so long a lifespan.\\\" [ 7 ] Dragon is the launching point for a number of rules, spells, monsters, magic items, and other ideas that were incorporated into later official products of the Dungeons & Dragons game. A prime example is the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, which first became known through a series of Dragon articles in the 1980s by its creator Ed Greenwood .  It subsequently went on to become one of the primary campaign \\\"worlds\\\" for official Dungeons and Dragons products, starting in 1987. The magazine appeared on the cover as simply Dragon from July 1980, [ 8 ] later changing its name to Dragon Magazine starting November 1987. [ 9 ] Wizards of the Coast [ edit ] Wizards of the Coast purchased TSR and its intellectual properties, including Dragon Magazine , in 1997. [ 10 ] Production was then transferred from Wisconsin to Washington state. In 1999, Wizards of the Coast was itself purchased by Hasbro, Inc. Dragon Magazine suffered a five-month gap between #236 and #237 but remained published by TSR as a subsidiary of WotC starting September 1997, [ 11 ] and until January 2000 when WotC became the listed de facto publisher. [ 12 ] They removed the word \\\"magazine\\\" from the cover title starting with the June 2000 issue, changing the publication's name back to simply Dragon . [ 13 ] In 1999 a CD-ROM compilation of the first 250 issues, called Dragon Magazine Archive , was released in PDF format with a special viewer. It includes the seven issues of The Strategic Review . The Dragon Magazine Archive is out of print because of issues raised with the 2001 ruling in Greenberg v. National Geographic regarding the reprint rights of various comic strips that had been printed in Dragon over the years and Paizo Publishing's policy that creators of comics retain their copyright. [ 14 ] These comic strips include Wormy , What's New with Phil & Dixie , Snarf Quest , and Knights of the Dinner Table [ 14 ] which is covered in TSR's own statement in the first issue that \\\"All material published herein becomes the exclusive property of the publisher unless special arrangements to the contrary are made.\\\" [ 6 ] Paizo [ edit ] In 2002, Paizo Publishing acquired the rights to publish both Dragon and Dungeon under license from Wizards of the Coast. Dragon was published by Paizo starting September 2002. [ 15 ] It ties Dragon more closely to Dungeon by including articles supporting and promoting its major multi-issue adventures such as the Age of Worms and Savage Tide . Class Acts , a monthly publication with one- or two-page articles offering ideas for developing specific character classes, were also introduced by Paizo. Return to Wizards of the Coast [ edit ] On April 18, 2007, Wizards of the Coast announced that it would not be renewing Paizo's licenses for Dragon and Dungeon, instead opting for online publishing. [ 1 ] Paizo published the last print editions of Dragon and Dungeon magazines for September 2007.

Although the lair itself is not in the Wilderness, KBD is still considered a Wilderness boss by designation, as players must enter the Wilderness to fight him. The King Black Dragon has a combat level of 276, which makes him one of the strongest dragons in Old School RuneScape . Players should not take this foe lightly, and they should always take an anti-dragon shield as his dragonfire breath is very deadly without protection. The King Black Dragon can also be killed as an alternative for a black dragon Slayer task , except when assigned by Krystilia . Although he will always fight back when attacked, he has gotten bored over the centuries from adventurers attacking him, as he revealed to his good friend Bob the cat . If you're going there for the first time, please note that KBD is aggressive and will aggro you , dealing damage from a distance through even super antifire potions , dragonfire shields , and protect from magic . While the King Black Dragon's lair is entered from within the Wilderness, his lair itself is not part of the Wilderness, so players cannot attack each other in his lair. Completion of the Wilderness Diary also does not note his bone drops. Players can pay 50,000 coins to open an instanced version of his lair (right-click Private option on lever), where it will be inaccessible by other players.

The burning amulet teleports the player to the Lava Maze just south-east of the fenced area containing the entrance to the lair. This is the fastest and most reliable method of getting there. Wilderness Obelisks can be used, but be wary that using them will make encountering high-level monsters or PKers more likely. Players who have completed the hard Wilderness Diary can choose the obelisk they wish to teleport to, namely the obelisk closest to the lair at level 44 Wilderness. The nearest obelisk can be accessed if the player teleports to the Corporeal Beast area via a games necklace , exits the cave, and runs south-east to the obelisk and then south-east again.

Dragon Dance Traditional Chinese 舞 龍 Simplified Chinese 舞 龙 Transcriptions Standard Mandarin Hanyu Pinyin wǔ lóng Yue: Cantonese Jyutping mou5 lung4 Alternative Chinese name Traditional Chinese 弄 龍 Transcriptions Southern Min Hokkien POJ lāng-liông or lāng-lêng Dragon dance ( simplified Chinese : 舞龙 ; traditional Chinese : 舞龍 ; pinyin : wǔ lóng ; Jyutping : mou5 lung4 ) is a form of traditional dance and performance in Chinese culture .  Like the lion dance , it is most often seen during festive celebrations.  The dance is performed by a team of experienced dancers who manipulate a long flexible giant puppet of a dragon using poles positioned at regular intervals along the length of the dragon.  The dance team simulates the imagined movements of this mythological creature in a sinuous, undulating manner. The dragon dance is often performed during Chinese New Year . The Chinese dragon is a symbol of China's culture, and it is believed to bring good luck to people, therefore the longer the dragon is in the dance, the more luck it will bring to the community. [ 1 ] The dragons are believed to possess qualities that include great power, dignity, fertility, wisdom and auspiciousness. The appearance of a dragon is both fearsome and bold but it has a benevolent disposition, and it was an emblem to represent imperial authority. The movements in a performance traditionally symbolize the power and dignity of the dragon. [ citation needed ] History [ edit ] Han dynasty stone relief engraving showing a form of Dragon Dance. Parade of a Chinese dragon in Seattle, c. 1909. The Millennium Dai Loong Dragon being paraded in Melbourne during 2008 Lunar New Year celebrations. During the Han dynasty , different forms of the dragon dance were described in ancient texts.  Rain dance performed at times of drought may involve the use of figures of dragon as Chinese dragon was associated with rain in ancient China, for example the dragon Yinglong was considered a rain deity, [ 2 ] and the Shenlong had the power to determine how much wind and rain to bring. [ 3 ] According to the Han dynasty text Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals by Dong Zhongshu , as part of a ritual to appeal for rain, clay figures of the dragons were made and children or adults may then perform a dance.  The number of dragons, their length and color, as well as the performers may vary according to the time of year. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Other dances involving dragons may be found in a popular form of entertainment during the Han dynasty, the baixi ( 百戲 ) variety shows , where performers called \\\"mime people\\\" ( 象人 ) dressed up as various creatures such as beasts, fish and dragons. In his Lyric Essay on Western Capital ( 西京賦 ) Zhang Heng recorded various performances such as performers who dressed as a green dragon playing a flute, and a fish-dragon act where fish transformed into a dragon. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] A version of the fish-dragon dance called \\\"fish-dragon extending\\\" ( 魚龍曼延 ) was also performed at the Han court to entertain foreign guests – in this dance a mythical beast of Shenli ( 舍利之獸 ) transforms into flounder, then to a dragon. [ 9 ] These ancient dances however do not resemble modern Dragon Dance in their descriptions, and depictions of dragon dance in Han dynasty stone relief engravings suggest that the props used may also be cumbersome, unlike modern Dragon Dance where light-weight dragons are manipulated by performers. [ 10 ] The dragon acts of the Han dynasty were also mentioned in the Tang \"\n}\n**Web Page 8:**\n{\n  \"id\": 8,\n  \"title\": \"Updates | TibiaWiki - Fandom\",\n  \"url\": \"https://tibia.fandom.com/wiki/Updates\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Content regarding Tibia's 20 Anniversary, including the annual First Dragon Quest, was already implemented on this update.

Provide your answer as just an integer value.\n\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the volume of Freon-12 (also known as dichlorodifluoromethane) when it is in a liquid state at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, which is approximately 11,000 meters deep. The temperature at the bottom of the trench can be estimated as the pressure at that depth, converted to temperature using the Clapeyron-Clausius equation, and then using the density of Freon-12 to find the volume.\n\nStep 1: Determine the pressure at the bottom of the Marianas Trench.\nThe pressure at the bottom of the Marianas Trench is approximately 1085 atm (since 1 atm ≈ 10.3 meters of water column, and 11,000 meters / 10.3 meters/atm ≈ 1085 atm).\n\nStep 2: Convert the pressure to temperature using the Clapeyron-Clausius equation.\nThe Clapeyron-Clausius equation relates the change in pressure and temperature for a phase change. For Freon-12, we can use the boiling point and the heat of vaporization to estimate the temperature at the given pressure. However, for simplicity, we can use the fact that the boiling point of Freon-12 is around 23.8°C at 1 atm. At 1085 atm, the temperature will be much higher, but we can use the ideal gas law to estimate the volume.\n\nStep 3: Use the ideal gas law to find the volume.\nThe ideal gas law is PV = nRT, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature in Kelvin. However, since Freon-12 is a liquid at this pressure, we can use the density to find the volume.\n\nThe density of liquid Freon-12 at room temperature is approximately 1.36 g/mL.

It is commonly regarded as one of the most successful, if controversial, mega-projects of the 20th century, bringing together scientific expertise, industrial production, and military coordination to create an entirely new industry, and new form of weaponry, in an unusually compressed timescale. Within the literature of the history of science and technology, the Manhattan Project has been examined from a number of different vantage points, often centering on the role of the thousands of academic scientists in hundreds of centers who participated in the weaponization of a new scientific discovery to facilitate the mass slaughter of civilians, but also portraying the project as a prototype of future military-industrial-academic collaborations. Historiographical background The Manhattan Project per se specifically refers to the overarching weapons-production program begun in late 1942, and not to earlier research and pilot programs. It is related to but not exactly the same as the Manhattan Engineer District, the division of the US Army Corps of Engineers that was in charge of implementing the development of the atomic bomb, and which maintained control over the technology until January 1947, when the civilian US Atomic Energy Commission took over all production operations. This definitional issue is not an insubstantial one. If one assigns the moniker of the Manhattan Project to the earliest investigations into nuclear fission, it results in a significantly different narrative about the purpose and origins of the weapons project, and obscures the distinct change of direction that took place in late 1942. At times, it was in the interest of government officials involved in making the atomic bomb to stress the continuity with earlier research, as the original motivation for the project (fear of the Nazis) was seen as easier to justify than the later stages of it. 1 Image 1: This map shows the geographic distribution of the several hundred sites that were operated as part of the Manhattan Project. They varied widely in size, type, and category. The three major sites (Hanford, Oak Ridge, and Los Alamos) have their circles artificially enlarged, as do the secondary sites of UC Berkeley, the University of Chicago, and the Trinity site. Blue indicates the site was of a directly military or governmental nature (or were wholly created by the government); orange indicates educational institutions; green indicates industrial sites and contractors. Some sites in Canada are indicated, but there are several international sites that do not appear on this map. Source data was compiled from contract listings and entries in the Manhattan District History and OSRD files by Alex Wellerstein, who also created the map.

Hsiang and Amir S. Jina NBER Working Paper No. 20352 July 2014 JEL No. H87,O11,O44,Q51,Q54,R11 ABSTRACT Does the environment have a causal effect on economic development? Using meteorological data, we reconstruct every country's exposure to the universe of tropical cyclones during 1950-2008. We exploit random within-country year-to-year variation in cyclone strikes to identify the causal effect of environmental disasters on long-run growth. We compare each country's growth rate to itself in the years immediately before and after exposure, accounting for the distribution of cyclones in preceding years. The data reject hypotheses that disasters stimulate growth or that short-run losses disappear following migrations or transfers of wealth. Instead, we find robust evidence that national incomes decline, relative to their pre-disaster trend, and do not recover within twenty years. Both rich and poor countries exhibit this response, with losses magnified in countries with less historical cyclone experience. Income losses arise from a small but persistent suppression of annual growth rates spread across the fifteen years following disaster, generating large and significant cumulative effects: a 90th percentile event reduces per capita incomes by 7.4% two decades later, effectively undoing 3.7 years of average development. The gradual nature of these losses render them inconspicuous to a casual observer, however simulations indicate that they have dramatic influence over the long-run development of countries that are endowed with regular or continuous exposure to disaster. Linking these results to projections of future cyclone activity, we estimate that under conservative discounting assumptions the present discounted cost of \\\"business as usual\\\" climate change is roughly $9.7 trillion larger than previously thought.

Steinhardt Stephen Wolfram Signature Richard Phillips Feynman ( / ˈ f aɪ n m ə n / ; May 11, 1918 – February 15, 1988) was an American theoretical physicist . He is best known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics , the theory of quantum electrodynamics , the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium , and in particle physics , for which he proposed the parton model . For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 jointly with Julian Schwinger and Shin'ichirō Tomonaga . Feynman developed a pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions describing the behavior of subatomic particles , which later became known as Feynman diagrams and is widely used. During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World , he was ranked the seventh-greatest physicist of all time. [ 1 ] He assisted in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II and became known to the wider public in the 1980s as a member of the Rogers Commission , the panel that investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster . Along with his work in theoretical physics, Feynman has been credited with having pioneered the field of quantum computing and introducing the concept of nanotechnology . He held the Richard C. Tolman professorship in theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology. Feynman was a keen popularizer of physics through both books and lectures, including a talk on top-down nanotechnology, \\\" There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom \\\" (1959) and the three-volumes of his undergraduate lectures, The Feynman Lectures on Physics (1961–1964). He delivered lectures for lay audiences, recorded in The Character of Physical Law (1965) and QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter (1985). Feynman also became known through his autobiographical books Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! (1985) and What Do You Care What Other People Think? (1988), and books written about him such as Tuva or Bust! by Ralph Leighton and the biography Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman by James Gleick . Early life [ edit ] Feynman was born on May 11, 1918, in New York City, [ 2 ] to Lucille ( née Phillips ; 1895–1981), a homemaker, and Melville Arthur Feynman (1890–1946), a sales manager. [ 3 ] Feynman's father was born into a Jewish family in Minsk , Russian Empire , [ 4 ] and immigrated with his parents to the United States at the age of five. Feynman's mother was born in the United States into a Jewish family. Lucille's father had emigrated from Poland, and her mother also came from a family of Polish immigrants. She trained as a primary school teacher but married Melville in 1917, before taking up a profession. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Richard was a late talker and did not speak until after his third birthday. As an adult, he spoke with a New York accent [ 5 ] [ 6 ] strong enough to be perceived as an affectation or exaggeration, [ 7 ] [ 8 ] so much so that his friends Wolfgang Pauli and Hans Bethe once commented that Feyn\"\n}\n**Web Page 10:**\n{\n  \"id\": 10,\n  \"title\": \"Group Hu - Department of Physics and Astronomy\",\n  \"url\": \"http://www2.physics.umanitoba.ca/u/hu/\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Welcome to the spintronics group at the Department of Physics & Astronomy, University of Manitoba, Canada.

For the word itself, see Antidisestablishmentarianism (word) . Arms of the See of Canterbury , governing the Church of England Antidisestablishmentarianism ( / ˌ æ n t i d ɪ s ɪ ˌ s t æ b l ɪ ʃ m ə n ˈ t ɛər i ə n ɪ z əm / ⓘ , US also / ˌ æ n t aɪ -/ ⓘ ) is a position that advocates that a state church (the \\\"established church\\\") should continue to receive government patronage, rather than be disestablished (i.e., be separated from the state). [ 1 ] [ 2 ] In 19th century Britain , it developed as a political movement in opposition to disestablishmentarianism , the Liberal Party 's efforts to disestablish or remove the Church of England as the official state church of England, Ireland , and Wales . The Church's status has been maintained in England, but in Ireland, the Anglican Church of Ireland was disestablished in 1871. In Wales, four Church of England dioceses were disestablished in 1920 and became the Church in Wales . In colonial America, the Church of England was disestablished in six colonies despite its mild popularity in the 1780s; many Anglicans in America began to refer to themselves as Episcopalians . [ 3 ] History [ edit ] The matter of disestablishment of the Church of England is an ongoing issue, often tied with the position of the Monarchy of the United Kingdom as \\\"Supreme Governor\\\" of the Church (see Act of Settlement 1701 ). British philosopher Phillip Blond , an advocate of the antidisestablishmentarian position, argues that England's having a state church has prevented the country from embracing any sort of ethnic or racial nationalism. [ 4 ] Blond has stated that official patronage of the Church of England has allowed the country to withstand and speak against totalitarian ideologies of the 20th century that were plaguing other parts of the world. [ 4 ] He further opined that \\\"Just as we need the church to protect the political, so we need it to protect the idea of civil society.\\\" [ 4 ] Blond concludes that the \\\"church establishment in England creates a more diverse political and social life, prevents religious extremism and helps to minimise partisan conflict and secular violence.\\\" [ 4 ] Giles Coren , a British writer, supports antidisestablishmentarianism because it allows all English people to receive meaningful rites such as marriage. [ 5 ] In April 2014, Nick Clegg , then Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Leader of the Liberal Democrats , said that he thought the Church of England and the British state should be separated \\\"in the long run\\\". [ 6 ] David Cameron , the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom at the time, responded to Clegg's comments by stating that the position was \\\"a long-term Liberal idea, but it is not a Conservative one\\\", adding that he believed the existence of an established church is beneficial.

The English word antidisestablishmentarianism ( UK / ˌ æ n t i d ɪ s ɪ ˌ s t æ b l ɪ ʃ m ə n ˈ t ɛər i ə n ɪ z əm / ⓘ US / ˌ æ n t aɪ -/ ⓘ ) is notable for its unusual length of 28 letters and 12 syllables, and is one of the longest words in the English language . [ 1 ] It has been cited as the longest word in the English language (excluding coined and technical terms), although some dictionaries do not recognize it because of its low usage in everyday lexicon. [ 2 ] Antidisestablishmentarianism is a political position that originated in 19th century Britain. The position opposed proposals at that time to remove the Anglican Church 's status as the established church of England, Ireland, and Wales, but not in Scotland, which had and still has its own separate national church. [ 3 ] The word became known in the public realm in the US via a popular television game show in the 1950s, The $64,000 Question , when a young contestant correctly spelled it to win. [ 4 ] Recognition [ edit ] There is varied recognition of antidisestablishmentarianism among major English dictionaries . Merriam-Webster does not recognize the word because it is practically unused in the modern era, although they do include disestablishmentarianism and antiestablishmentarianism . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language , [ 7 ] Chambers Dictionary , [ 8 ] and Oxford English Dictionary [ 9 ] similarly exclude antidisestablishmentarianism , but keep smaller variations. Dictionaries that do include the word are the Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary , [ citation needed ] Collins English , [ 10 ] and Dictionary.com . [ 11 ] The longest word found in a major dictionary is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis , but this is a technical term that was coined specifically to be the longest word. [ 1 ] [ 12 ] Construction of the word [ edit ] The word construction is as follows (succeeded by the number of letters in the word): establish (9) to set up, put in place, or institute (originally from the Latin stare , to stand) dis-establish (12) to end the established status of a body, in particular a church, given such status by law, such as the Church of England disestablish-ment (16) the separation of church and state (specifically, the goal of the political movement of the 1860s in Britain) disestablishment-arian (21) one who subscribes to said movement anti-disestablishmentarian (25) one who opposes said movement antidisestablishmentarian-ism (28) the movement or ideology that opposes disestablishment The word construction could be lengthened further in many ways, for example: antidisestablishmentarian-istically (34) doing something with antidisestablishmentarian intentions. In popular culture [ edit ] A slightly longer but less commonly accepted variant can be found in the Duke Ellington song \\\"You're Just an Old Antidisestablishmentarianismist\\\".

( April 2025 ) The Simple English Wiktionary has a definition for: antidisestablishmentarianism . Antidisestablishmentarianism is a political position. It means \\\"to keep an established church\\\". An official state church is called the \\\"established\\\" church, so a dis establishment arian is a person who wants to stop the state church. These people say a state church hurts the freedom of religion . These people say the state should be secular , meaning religion and the country are separate. This idea is called disestablishmentarian ism. So anti disestablishmentarianism wants to keep the state church. [ 1 ] It is famous because it is one of the longest words in the English language. History in England [ change | change source ] The word comes from England in the 1800s. In England, Ireland and Wales, there was an official state church called the Anglican Church. Ireland disestablished in 1871, and Wales disestablished in 1920. England still has the Anglican Church as the state church. In 2014 Nick Clegg , who was the leader of the Liberal Democrats at the time, said that he thought the Church of England should no longer be the established church. [ 2 ] David Cameron , who was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , said the establishment helps the church and state. As a word [ change | change source ] Antidisestablishmentarianism is one of the longest words in the English language . It has 28 letters and 12 syllables . It is considered to be the longest word, if you do not count technical terms. For example, \\\"pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis\\\" is a technical term for the lung disease asbestosis , made by people who wanted it to be the longest word. [ 3 ] However, while some dictionaries, such as the Cambridge dictionary have decided to include antidisestablishmentarianism, Merriam-Webster has stated that it will not add the word  to its dictionaries due to a lack of widespread use. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] In pop culture [ change | change source ] The word became famous because of a popular television show in the 1950s called The $64,000 Question , where someone spelled it and won. Duke Ellington , a jazz artist, had a song called \\\"You're Just an Old Antidisestablishmentarianismist\\\". [ 6 ] Eminem , a rapper , used the word in his song \\\"Almost Famous\\\".

However, the provided search results do not explicitly state numerical data for nonindigenous crocodile sightings in Florida between 2000 and 2020.

The general dorsal coloration is black, but light juvenile markings may be present in adults; young have bold, yellowish crossbands on a black background (Grenard, 1991; Conant and Collins, 1998). The voice of both males and females is a throaty, deep, bellowing roar (McIlhenny, 1935; Elliott, 1994; Conant and Collins, 1998). Elliott (1994) has made a recording of this penetrating roar available on a CD. Females may grunt like pigs when calling to their young (McIlhenny, 1935; Conant and Collins, 1998). American alligators have been illustrated by numerous authors over the years; the list provided here is not exhaustive (Reese, 1912; McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Guggisberg, 1972; Carr, 1973; Mount, 1975; Perrero, 1975; Smith and Smith, 1977; Behler and King, 1979; Toops, 1979; Martof et al., 1980; Smith and Brodie, 1982; Garrett and Barker, 1987; Webb et al., 1987; [Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Hirschhorn, 1989; Lazell, 1989; Ross, 1989; Ross and Magnusson, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Carmichael and Williams, 1991; Glasgow, 1991; Grenard, 1991; Mahony, 1991; Ross and Ernst, 1994; Palmer and Braswell, 1995; Lamar, 1997; Conant and Collins, 1998; Magnusson, 1998; Powell et al., 1998; Bartlett and Bartlett, 1999a, b; Behler, 1999; Zug et al., 2001). Size: total length of 1.8 - 5 m Native Range: The indigenous range of A. mississippiensis is from coastal North Carolina south to southern Florida and the Keys, and westward through the Deep South to central Texas and extreme southeastern Oklahoma (Martof, 1956; Duellman and Schwartz, 1958; Webb, 1970; Mount, 1975; Stevenson, 1976; Martof et al., 1980; Lohoefener and Altig, 1983; Garrett and Barker, 1987; Groombridge, 1987; Moler, 1988; [Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]; Carpenter and Krupa, 1989; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; King, 1989, 2000; Lazell, 1989; Ross and Magnusson, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Carmichael and Williams, 1991; Gibbons and Semlitsch, 1991; Grenard, 1991; Ross and Ernst, 1994; Palmer and Braswell, 1995; Conant and Collins, 1998; Bartlett and Bartlett, 1999a, b; Behler, 1999; Dixon, 2000; Meshaka et al., 2000). American alligators may eventually be found in Mexico in localities adjacent to the Texas border (Smith and Smith, 1976, 1977, 1993; Ross and Ernst, 1994). Over much of its range A. mississippiensis has been eliminated, making an accurate determination of its modern distribution difficult (Ross and Ernst, 1994; Conant and Collins, 1998).

Size: 2.3-3.7 m total length Native Range: In North America, C. acutus lives at the northernmost extent of its range, found only along the extreme southern coastline of Florida, including the Keys, primarily confined to the counties of Dade and Monroe, with individuals wandering as far north as Palm Beach County on the east coast and Sarasota County on the west coast; these northern wanderings may encompass their historical range (Reese, 1915; Duellman and Schwartz, 1958; Carr, 1973; Stevenson, 1976; Moler, 1988, 1992; Kushlan and Mazzotti, 1989a; Lazell, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Carmichael and Williams, 1991; Conant and Collins; 1998; Bartlett and Bartlett, 1999; Ernst et al., 1999; King, 2000; Meshaka et al., 2000). The rest of its range includes Atlantic and Pacific coastal regions of Mexico, Central America, and northern South America as far south as Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador and Peru, and the Caribbean islands of Cuba, Cayman Brac, Little Cayman, Jamaica, Hispaniola, Martinique, and Margarita (Barbour and Ramsden, 1919; Smith and Smith, 1976, 1977, 1993; Alvarez del Toro, 1982; Schwartz and Henderson, 1985, 1991; Groombridge, 1987; King, 1989; Ross and Magnusson, 1989; Grenard, 1991; Flores-Villela, 1993; Powell et al., 1996, 1999; Campbell, 1998; Crombie, 1999; Ernst et al., 1999; Estrada and Ruibal, 1999; Kaiser et al., 2001).  The American crocodile seems to be extirpated from Trinidad (Murphy, 1997).

Ecology: In Florida, C. acutus prefers brackish waters and coastal mangrove swamps but may wander inland or out to sea (Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Moler, 1992). One population of American Crocodiles exists in the canal system of a Florida power plant (Gaby et al., 1985; Grenard, 1991). Adults are fairly tolerant of high salinity levels, but the young may be dependent on drinking from lenses of freshwater that temporarily float on heavier saltwater following rainfall (Moler, 1992). The diet consists mostly of crabs, fish, snakes, turtles, birds, and small mammals (including dogs), with insects and spiders included in the diet of juveniles (Moler, 1992). In Florida, mating occurs in late winter and early spring (Moler, 1992). Females lay hard-shelled eggs in April or May, which are buried in a simple hole or mound of soil or on a beach, stream bank, or canal levee (Gaby et al., 1985; Kushlan and Mazzotti, 1989b; Grenard, 1991; Moler, 1992). Females are not as diligent about protecting the nest as Alligator mississippiensis , but will open the nest at hatching and transport young to the water in their mouths (Kushlan and Mazzotti, 1989b; Moler, 1992). Means of Introduction: This crocodile was illegally transported to Virginia then released into the swamp (Mitchell, 1994).  Pet release in Puerto Rico. Although the island of Puerto Rico is outside the normal native range for this species, an adult could theoretically have swum to Puerto Rico; however, because the individual collected was a juvenile, it is believed to be the result of a pet release. This same area also hosts a population of spectacled caiman ( C. crocodylus ) that resulted from pet releases (Lever, 2003; Kraus, 2009). Status: This single C. acutus was collected; they are not established in Virginia (Mitchell, 1994), or in Puerto Rico. Impact of Introduction: The impacts of this species are currently unknown, as no studies have been done to determine how it has affected ecosystems in the invaded range. The absence of data does not equate to lack of effects. It does, however, mean that research is required to evaluate effects before conclusions can be made. Remarks: Several authors have summarized or reviewed the taxonomy of C. acutus (Smith and Smith, 1977; King, 1989; Ernst et al., 1999)\"\n}\n**Web Page 5:**\n{\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"title\": \"Burmese pythons in Florida: A synthesis of biology, impacts, and ...\",\n  \"url\": \"https://neobiota.pensoft.net/article/90439/\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Distribution of Burmese python (Python molurus bivittatus) body size in southern Florida, USA (n = 9,501) varying from 34.44 cm to 500.9 cm SVL ...\",\n  \"context\": \"Burmese pythons in Florida: A synthesis of biology, impacts, and management tools Home Articles About About Pensoft Books Journals Blog Register | Login Related articles by Review Article NeoBiota 80: 1-119 https://doi.org/10.3897/neobiota.80.90439 (10 Jan 2023) Other versions: ABOUT PENSOFT Company Profile Innovations & Tools Open Access & APC Policies Terms of Use Editorial Policies General Policies PRODUCTS Journals Advanced Books Conventional Books Conference Abstracts Conference Proceedings SERVICES For Authors For Journals For Books For Conferences For Organisations PROJECTS Research Projects Services Partners Brochure ARPHA ARPHA Publishing Platform ARPHA Manual ARPHA Pricing Web Services GET IN TOUCH Contacts Publishing Inquiry Migrate Your Journal Open a New Journal Follow PENSOFT Blog & News Subscribe Media Center © Pensoft Publishers 2025 (Verbatim name) ID (Catalog Number) DES Invalid DOI was provided, please try again XML PDF Bluesky Twitter Facebook Telegram Mendeley Reddit Notify a colleague Contents Contents Article Info Article Info Cite Cite Metrics Metrics Comment Comment Related Related Figs Figs Tabs Tabs Taxa Taxa Data Data Refs Refs Cited Cited Erratum Erratum Nanopubs Nanopubs Article title ﻿Abstract Keywords ﻿Introduction ﻿Natural history of Burmese pythons ﻿Identification ﻿Taxonomy ﻿Demography Survival Mortality Reproduction Size distribution Hatchling size Size at maturity Maximum size Growth and longevity ﻿Physiology Thermal biology Osmoregulation Energetics and digestion ﻿Detection probability ﻿Types of detection probability Species detection Environmental DNA as a detection tool for pythons Challenges with eDNA Individual detection ﻿Burmese python arrival in Florida ﻿History of imports into the USA ﻿History of the invasive Florida population ﻿Introduction scenarios Primary introduction Possible secondary introduction Population genetics ﻿Status of the Florida population ﻿Abundance Challenges interpreting removal data Density ﻿Geographic distribution Range in Florida Early detection using eDNA Potential range Refugia Cold tolerance ﻿Movement Navigation and homing Dispersal Home range Habitat use ﻿Burmese python impacts ﻿Human safety ﻿Direct ecological impacts on wildlife Foraging strategy Diet Species of concern Mammal declines ﻿Indirect ecological impacts Parasites and pathogens Trophic-structure changes ﻿What do we know about control tools? ﻿Visual and road surveys Removal programs Cost of visual surveys Future applications of visual surveys ﻿Scout snakes Cost of scout snakes Future applications of scout snakes ﻿Trapping Experiments Cost of trapping Challenges with trapping ﻿Pheromones ﻿Scent detection dogs Cost of scent detection dogs ﻿Toxicants ﻿Control tool summary ﻿Future research ﻿Population suppression ﻿Refinement of existing control tools Baseline abundance estimation Relative abundance and abundance indices ﻿Long-term projects and infrastructure ﻿Biologging tools to inform python behavior ﻿Development of new control tools Technical aspects of the research Gene drive regulation and stakeholder engagement Demography and genetic biocontrol ﻿Conclusions ﻿Acknowledgements References Supplementary materials Subscribe to email alerts for current Article's categories Powered by This website uses cookies in order to improve your web experience.

Duméril & Bibron , 1836 Alligator mississippiensis [ sic ] — Holbrook , 1842 The American alligator ( Alligator mississippiensis ), sometimes referred to as a common alligator or simply gator , is a large crocodilian reptile native to the Southeastern United States . It is one of the two extant species in the genus Alligator , and is larger than the only other living alligator species, the Chinese alligator . Adult male American alligators measure 3.4 to 4.5 m (11.2 to 14.8 ft) in length, and can weigh up to 500 kg (1,100 lb), with unverified sizes of up to 5.84 m (19.2 ft) and weights of 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) making it the second longest and the heaviest of the family Alligatoridae , after the black caiman . Females are smaller, measuring 2.6 to 3 m (8.5 to 9.8 ft) in length. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] The American alligator inhabits subtropical and tropical freshwater wetlands , such as marshes and cypress swamps , from southern Texas to North Carolina . [ 9 ] It is distinguished from the sympatric American crocodile by its broader snout, with overlapping jaws and darker coloration, and is less tolerant of saltwater but more tolerant of cooler climates than the American crocodile, which is found only in tropical and warm subtropical climates. American alligators are apex predators and consume fish, amphibians , reptiles, birds, and mammals . Hatchlings feed mostly on invertebrates . They play an important role as ecosystem engineers in wetland ecosystems through the creation of alligator holes, which provide both wet and dry habitats for other organisms. Throughout the year (in particular during the breeding season), American alligators bellow to declare territory, and locate suitable mates. [ 10 ] Male American alligators use infrasound to attract females. Eggs are laid in a nest of vegetation, sticks, leaves, and mud in a sheltered spot in or near the water. Young are born with yellow bands around their bodies and are protected by their mother for up to one year. [ 11 ] This species displays parental care, which is rare for most reptiles. Mothers protect their eggs during the incubation period, and move the hatchlings to the water using their mouths. [ 12 ] The conservation status of the American alligator is listed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature . Historically, hunting had decimated their population, and the American alligator was listed as an endangered species by the Endangered Species Act of 1973 . Subsequent conservation efforts have allowed their numbers to increase and the species was removed from endangered status in 1987. The species is the official state reptile of three states: Florida , Louisiana , and Mississippi . History and taxonomy [ edit ] The American alligator was first classified in 1801 by French zoologist François Marie Daudin as Crocodilus mississipiensis . In 1807, Georges Cuvier created the genus Alligator for it, [ 13 ] based on the English common name alligator (derived from Spanish word el lagarto , \\\"the lizard\\\"). The American alligator and its closest living relative, the Chinese alligator , belong the subfamily Alligatorinae . Alligatorinae is the sister group to the caimans of Caimaninae , which together comprise the family Alligato\"\n}\n**Web Page 7:**\n{\n  \"id\": 7,\n  \"title\": \"Caiman crocodilus\",\n  \"url\": \"https://invasions.si.edu/nemesis/chesreport/species_summary/caiman%20crocodilus\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Common Caiman crocodiles are native to central and South America from southern Mexico to Argentina.

Juveniles were sold in the pet trade in the 1950s, when having a baby alligator as a pet was popular. But like all cute baby animals, they grow up. Male caimans can get as large as 8 feet long, much too large and dangerous for a family pet, so before they had the chance to eat themselves out of house and home, they were released into the wild. The first introductions were in canals in Miami, FL where they became established. Colder winters north of Southern Florida prevent the establishment of breeding populations, but there have been many reports of released caimans discovered along the East Coast as far north as Boston, MA. There are several reports of released animals in the Chesapeake Bay region, mainly from Virginia, and in August 2010, one was caught outside Baltimore. Since the animals die at about 54°F, they won’t survive in the Bay.

This crocodilian was widely sold in the pet trade as juvenile 'baby alligators'.  It was apparently introduced to canals in the Miami FL area in the late 1950s, and was established by the 1960s (Butterfield et al. 1997).  Currently, the breeding range of this species is from Lake Jessup in Seminole County, to Florida City, Dade county (Poss et al. 2000). Caiman crocodilus seems to be unable to tolerate temperatures below 12-15 C (Brandt and Mazzotti 1990), so that this species is unlikely to become established beyond Southern FL. Scattered records of individual C. crocodilus are known in several U.S. states, including the region of Boston MA and the St. Johns river drainage FL, the lower Colorado Basin in AZ, the Central Valley of CA (Florida Caribbean Science Center 2001), all outside the species' thermal tolerance range.  In the Chesapeake Bay region, there are at least 4 records of individual animals, from Lake Whitehurst in Norfolk VA, from a pond in eastern Henrico County VA, and from Fourmile Creek, Arlington VA (Mitchell 1994), and from ponds on the tidal  Patapsco River, near Brooklyn Park (Roylance 2010).  Breeding and overwintering of these creatures are extremely unlikely, unless they have access to warm effluents.

        "turn_1_webpage_analyses": "The USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database indicates that nonindigenous crocodiles in Florida include species such as *Morelet's Crocodile (Crocodylus moreletii)* and *Nile Crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus)*, which are listed as exotic in Florida (Web Page 10). However, the provided search results do not explicitly state numerical data for nonindigenous crocodile sightings in Florida between 2000 and 2020.  Key details from the sources:  1. **American Crocodile (*Crocodylus acutus*)**: Native to southern Florida, it is not considered nonindigenous there. Nonindigenous occurrences outside Florida (e.g., Virginia and Puerto Rico) are noted, but these are irrelevant to the query (Web Page 4).  2. **Caiman crocodilus (Common Caiman)**: Introduced to Florida canals in the 1960s via the pet trade, with scattered reports but no established populations beyond southern Florida. However, caimans are part of the alligator family (Alligatoridae), not true crocodiles (Crocodylidae), so they may not qualify under the query's scope (Web Page 7).  3. **Other Crocodilians**: Web Page 10 lists *Morelet's Crocodile* and *Nile Crocodile* as exotic in Florida, but no specific counts or temporal data (2000–2020) are provided in the snippets.  **Conclusion**: While the NAS database confirms the presence of nonindigenous crocodilian species in Florida, the exact number of nonindigenous *crocodiles* (Crocodylidae) reported between 2000 and 2020 is not explicitly stated in the provided web pages. Further direct access to the NAS database or additional filtered searches would be required to retrieve this specific data.  **Next Steps**:  - Refine the search query to explicitly target *Crocodylus* species (e.g., \"Morelet's Crocodile\" or \"Nile Crocodile\") in Florida between 2000–2020.  - Check the NAS database's \"Nonindigenous Occurrences\" tables or annual reports for quantitative data."

These drawbacksunderscoretheneedforageneralized,modularmulti-agentarchitecturethatcanberapidlyadapted todiversedomainswithminimalretrainingandredesign. Buildingupontheseobservations,firstly,weintroduce WORKFORCE,ahierarchicalmulti-agentinference frameworkthatdecouplesstrategicplanningfromdomain-specificexecution. AsisshowninFigure2,This modular design comprises three core components: (i) Domain-agnostic Planner: Generates abstract task decompositionsbasedonhigh-levelgoals. (ii)Coordinator: Assignssubtaskstoappropriateworkers. (ii) Domain-specific Worker Nodes: A set of specialized agents that perform tool calls to accomplish each subtasks. Thedecouplingofthesecomponentsenablesplug-and-playextensibility,allowingWORKFORCE to be seamlessly adapted to new domains by simply replacing or adding worker nodes. Furthermore, this modulararchitecturefacilitates OPTIMIZED WORKFORCE LEARNING (OWL),anovelmulti-agenttraining paradigm. OWL focuses on enhancing MAS’s cross-domain transferability by training a generalizable domain-agnostic planner. Specifically, we employ a two-stage training strategy: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for planner initialization, followed by Reinforcement Learning [29] to further enhance the model’s generalizationcapabilities.

Laney School of Graduate Studies of Emory University in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in English 2016Abstract Imperial Postcoloniality: Narrative, Race and Reproduction in White Settler Histories By Alyssa Stalsberg Canelli My dissertation proposes a term, “imperial postcoloniality,” which describes the particular situation of settler colonialism in which independence is simultaneously elaborated through new configurations of colonialism, imperialism and racialization. The imperial postcolonial condition is reproduced through a complex set of affiliations, repudiations and reconciliations with the parent colonial power, and sustained through a kinship of shared whiteness. This project explores literary representations of the racialized narrative structures of the new white settler nations. By analyzing texts written by J.M. Coetzee, Nadine Gordimer and Zoe Wicomb to Nathaniel Hawthorne, Ralph Waldo Emerson and William Apess, I argue that at the heart of the imperial postcolonial nation’s imagined community lies an anxiety over the origins and reproduction of the nation. Further, it is precisely this anxiety that exposes the modes of racialized desire that are central to the nation’s ideological and material reproduction. However, this white settler narration is continually unsettled by other voices and presences, including its own fictions of whiteness. In fact, the cohesion of national narratives is always threatened by the historical reality of non-linear, dispossessed, obscured and rerouted lines of descent. Although the comparativism of this project is historically non-contiguous, it is grounded in a tradition of comparative historical work, inaugurated by George F. Frederickson’s White Supremacy: A Comparative Study of American and South African\"\n}\n**Web Page 9:**\n{\n  \"id\": 9,\n  \"title\": \"2023 FINAL COPY of C.Bordeaux's Dissertation - eScholarship\",\n  \"url\": \"https://escholarship.org/content/qt6558h8j4/qt6558h8j4_noSplash_023d85ac71d12488b64872acc27d15e9.pdf?t=rvtuma\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"still does, reference Deloria's work as touch points for life lessons.

Methodologically and theoretically, Indigenous articulations of relationality are the primary tool I use to communicate Lakota kinship values' interrelatedness. I illustrate a Lakota relationality through Lakota cultural connections to other-than-human beings and the use of creative practices as established through storytelling, poetry, and material culture that is represented within an accessible articulation of Očéti Šakówiŋ (Northern Plains tribal) communities. My analysis applies Lakota concepts of ikčé, the everyday, and wówayupike, ingenuity, to reify a continuum of Očéti Šakówiŋ artistic engagements. I concentrate on Lakota culture, which I know intimately, and employ self- reflexivity to articulate a Lakota relationality in present-day terms. My research engages Indigenous feminist praxis, autoethnographic and ethnographic methods with family members, regional Lakota artists, local Lakota culture bearers, and Lakota community organizers working iiand creating in the Northern Plains region. I analyze everyday examples of creative Lakota culture not confined by formal institutions like popular art galleries or non-native museums. Wówayupike: Relational Practices Between Art, Land, and Culture contributes to ongoing conversations about how Indigenous communities continue to adapt, evolve, and find joy—as they have always done—in the face of settler colonialism, structural racism, and the long historical trajectory of oppression in what is now the United States. iiiThis dissertation of Clementine Minnie Cat Bordeaux is approved.

While the exact title of the referenced work is not provided in the searched web pages, its role as the source for the paintings' titles is clear.

The Provisional Government of Oregon established Vancouver and Lewis Counties in 1845 in unorganized Oregon Country , extending from the Columbia River north to 54°40′ north latitude . After the region was organized within the Oregon Territory with the current northern border of 49° north, Vancouver County was renamed Clark , and six more counties were created out of Lewis County before the organization of Washington Territory in 1853; 28 were formed during Washington's territorial period, two of which only existed briefly. The final five were established in the 22 years after Washington was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Article XI of the Washington State Constitution addresses the organization of counties. New counties must have a population of at least 2,000 and no county can be reduced to a population below 4,000 due to partitioning to create a new county. [ 3 ] To alter the area of a county, the state constitution requires a petition of the \\\"majority of the voters\\\" in that area. A number of county partition proposals in the 1990s interpreted this as a majority of people who voted, until a 1998 ruling by the Washington Supreme Court clarified that they would need a majority of registered voters . [ 4 ] No changes to counties have been made since the formation of Pend Oreille County in 1911, except when the small area of Cliffdell was moved from Kittitas to Yakima County in 1970. [ 5 ] King County , home to the state's largest city, Seattle , holds almost 30% of Washington's population (2,340,211 residents of 7,958,180 in 2024), and has the highest population density, with more than 1,000 people per square mile (400/km 2 ). Garfield County is both the least populated (2,404) and least densely populated (3.4/sq mi [1.3/km 2 ]). Two counties, San Juan and Island , are composed only of islands. The average county is 1,830 square miles (4,700 km 2 ), with 204,056 people. Seventeen counties have Native American–derived names, including nine names of tribes whose land settlers would occupy. Another seventeen were named for political figures, only five of whom had lived in the region. The last five are named for geographic places. [ 6 ] The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, used by the United States government to uniquely identify counties, is provided with each entry. The FIPS code links in the table point to U.S. Census data pages for each county. Washington's FIPS state code is 53. Governance [ edit ] See also: Government of Washington (state) Population density map of Washington Counties provide a broad scope of services, including court operation, parks and recreation, libraries, arts, social services, elections, waste collection, roads and transportation, zoning and permitting, as well as taxation. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] The extent of these vary, and some are administered by municipalities. Counties are not subdivided into minor civil divisions like townships; sub-county local government is only by incorporated cities and towns , as well as by 29 Indian reservations , while unincorporated areas are governed only by the county. There are 242 census county divisions for statistical purpose\"\n}\n**Web Page 2:**\n{\n  \"id\": 2,\n  \"title\": \"County-City Reference List - Washington State Courts - Court Directory\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.courts.wa.gov/court_dir/?fa=court_dir.countycityref\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Washington Cities: Alphabetical List.

You’ve come to the right place! Counties are remnants of British mode of government, where lands were divided into ‘shires’ and ruled regionally. Everyone in Washington lives in one of 39 counties that make up the state. The effective thing about counties is that they are hyper local – county officials are from the county they are working for! Some more county duties include: Elections Roads Law Enforcement Health Water Quality Emergency Management Elections Counties, lead by the county Auditor, are in charge of administering elections. Between mailing and collecting ballots, and keeping all districts, cities, towns, and unincorporated areas organized, running elections is a huge task for counties. Roads Washington roads are taken care of by either the state, city, or the county. Only eight percent of roads in Washington are maintained by the state, and that means the rest is the responsibility of counties and cities. A large part of county budgets go toward road maintenance every year. Law Enforcement The county sheriff and their deputies are responsible for law enforcement on the county level – they are employed by the county and are often an elected position. The sheriff usually has jurisdiction over any unincorporated areas of his or her county. Duties of the sheriff’s office might include: investigating complaints, emergency response, patr olling, resolving disputes, making arrests, criminal investigations, and executing warrants. Health Washington has 31 county health departments, three multi-county health districts and two city-county health departments, all known as local health jurisdictions. They carry out a wide variety of programs to promote health, help prevent disease and build healthy communities. Water Quality Counties work to protect the environment and provide public water services for county residents. As regulators, counties are often responsible for controlling water pollution at the local level. They may enact rules on illicit discharges, remove septic tanks and adopt setbacks for land use plans. Counties also provide extensive outreach and education to residents and businesses on protecting water quality and reducing water pollution. Emergency Management Counties engage in all aspects and phases of emergency management: planning, preparedness, mitigation, response and recovery. This is for emergencies like wildfire, earthquake, storms, and other disasters that affect citizens county-wide. Elections Elections Counties, lead by the county Auditor, are in charge of administering elections.

It says where we should meet for our picnic on Friday. The only problem is, it’s encrypted in the Caesar cipher, so I can’t read it. Can you tell me what it says? This is the message:\n\nZsmxsm sc sx Zyvilsec Zvkjk.\n\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nTo decrypt the message encrypted in the Caesar cipher, we need to shift each letter of the alphabet backwards by a certain number of positions. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

This is a list of reigning non-sovereign monarchs in Asia , including traditional rulers and governing constitutional monarchs, but not the kings of Bahrain , Bhutan , Cambodia , Jordan , Saudi Arabia or Thailand , the emperor of Japan , the sultans of Brunei or Oman , or the emirs of Kuwait or Qatar . Each monarch listed below reigns over a legally recognised dominion, but in most cases possess little or no sovereign governing power. Their titles , however, are recognised by the state. Entries are listed beside their respective dominions, and are grouped by country. This is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources . Indonesia [ edit ] Present information regarding governmental recognition of traditional monarchs in Indonesia is inadequate. In some instances below, pre-colonial polities have been restored, and the royal titles of their leaders have been nominally confirmed. For example, in province of Maluku there are 545 kings who have the power to govern their respective areas at the village ( negeri ) level, while some others still have the status of hamlets ( dusun ) of the village but have their own king. [ 1 ] In other cases, the government has refused to revive monarchies that had been abolished during the earliest years of the republic . Despite the historical suppression of these dynasties, a large number have retained their culture, identity, and their status within their own communities. Royal titles are still widely used, bestowed in formal enthronement ceremonies conducted without formal recognition from Jakarta. [ citation needed ] In recent years, the number of dynasties receiving recognition as nominal cultural authorities has steadily increased. [ 2 ] However, because it remains unclear as to which monarchies have not yet been recognised, the list below will contain all extant Indonesian dynasties on which there is information available. Monarchs that have explicitly been denied recognition are listed under pretenders .

In some instances below, pre-colonial polities have been restored, and the royal titles of their leaders have been nominally confirmed. For example, in province of Maluku there are 545 kings who have the power to govern their respective areas at the village ( negeri ) level, while some others still have the status of hamlets ( dusun ) of the village but have their own king. [ 1 ] In other cases, the government has refused to revive monarchies that had been abolished during the earliest years of the republic . Despite the historical suppression of these dynasties, a large number have retained their culture, identity, and their status within their own communities. Royal titles are still widely used, bestowed in formal enthronement ceremonies conducted without formal recognition from Jakarta. [ citation needed ] In recent years, the number of dynasties receiving recognition as nominal cultural authorities has steadily increased. [ 2 ] However, because it remains unclear as to which monarchies have not yet been recognised, the list below will contain all extant Indonesian dynasties on which there is information available.

So, what other countries have a monarch? Royal Central takes a look. Asia, the largest continent, hosts the most countries with monarchies; 13 countries in Asia have a ruling family. They are Bahrain, Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, Malaysia, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates. The Jordanian Royal Family.

Those in the Americas are linked back to the United Kingdom, and all nine have Queen Elizabeth as their monarch; these are Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Belize, Canada, Grenada, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The King and Queen of Lesotho. By IAEA Imagebank/Flickr/CC BY-SA 2.0 The three African monarchies are Eswatini, Lesotho, and Morocco, while the six in the southern Pacific all have The Queen as their monarch, with the exception of Tonga, which has its own King. The five with Queen Elizabeth as monarch are Australia, New Zealand, Papa New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu. Not all monarchies are the same, and they vary based on their form – absolute, constitutional or federal. Constitutional monarchies, where there is a limit on the ruler’s power and shared group making decisions, are the most popular form. In some constitutional monarchies, like the United Kingdom and Sweden, the monarch is a non-political figurehead. Outside of Europe, Cambodia, Japan, Lesotho, and Malaysia are all constitutional monarchies. Bhutan, Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Qatar and Tonga are considered semi-constitutional or executive monarchies. The rulers of these countries wield considerable power but are not absolute monarchs. The King of Bhutan and his family in 2021. Photo: Royal Office for Media Absolute monarchies are when the King or queen has absolute power; this form of government is common in the Middle East and Africa. Brunei, Oman and Saudi Arabia are all ruled by absolute monarchs. In southern Africa, the Kingdom of Eswatini (formerly known as Swaziland) is an absolute monarchy with a twist; it could also be called a diarchy as it is ruled by the King and his mother. The two-people ruling system is in place to keep a check on power. There is also a parliament, and the King cannot choose his successor. When the King dies, a council will decide on the “Great Wife,” and the son of that wife will be the next monarch. The Emir of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is considered a federal monarchy. The UAE is made up of seven emirates, each with its own emir: Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras al-Khaimah, Sharjah and Umm al-Quwain. The head of the federal monarchy, referred to as the emir, is chosen from the rulers of the emirates. They rule as absolute monarchs in their emirates. So you see, despite the many monarchies not surviving the 20th century, there are still plenty left to read about.

Athit Perawongmetha/Reuters Post Blog posts represent the views of CFR fellows and staff and not those of CFR, which takes no institutional positions. King Maha Vajiralongkorn of Thailand has been on the throne for over eight years. There seem to be contrasting analyses of his reign and governance. (In theory, he is a constitutional monarch, like King Charles III of Britain. But he operates more closely to a Persian Gulf monarchy, with powers well beyond a constitutional monarchy.) On the one hand, Vajiralongkorn has actively interfered in Thai domestic politics much more openly than his father, suggesting the current king’s growing strength in the Thai political system. On the other hand, the rise of a more open anti-monarchy movement in Thailand, which has gained momentum and the willingness to be public despite harsh laws against criticizing the monarch, suggests that the monarchy is weaker than it appears. Consider the first analysis of the Vajiralongkorn reign, which asserts that he is a strong leader, as shown by his open willingness and confidence to intervene in politics and the economy. Soon after his enthronement, Vajiralongkorn flexed his power by requesting an amendment to the newly approved Thai constitution, a provision related to royal power. He asked for a change that would allow him to have the same powers even if he lived abroad—he spends a lot of time in Germany—instead of having to appoint a regent to oversee royal affairs on his behalf while abroad. This amendment allowed him to wield influence from Germany and diminished the power of the Privy Council, a group of senior advisors to the monarch who make recommendations and sometimes exercise power on his behalf. With the amendment, the king could live in Germany most of the time, not have to spend much time with the Privy Council, and make any decisions himself. More on: Thailand Rule of Law Diamonstein-Spielvogel Project on the Future of Democracy Other more open royal interventions in politics have included annexing certain military regiments under the direct control of the Royal Household, giving the king more open power over the armed forces, the other historically most important Thai institution. He was also confident enough to intervene in military affairs by handpicking the army chief.

In 2019, the military leaders who had seized power five years earlier with a coup d’état formed a civilian government via a carefully managed general election. Concomitantly, King Maha Vajiralongkorn, on the throne since 2016, underwent his coronation. While the rituals celebrated the formal beginning of his reign, the King exercised his influence over politics in ways deemed unusual for a country that calls itself a constitutional monarchy. In 2020, as COVID-19 spread worldwide, Thailand experienced more an economic than a health crisis. The number of infections remained remarkably low, but the economy recorded its worst performance since the financial crash of 1997. Only in 2021 did the pandemic become more important, the Government responding with Chinese-developed vaccines that many in Thailand deemed little efficacious. Enraged by political instability, economic stagnation, public health emergencies, and deepening relations with China, throughout 2020-2021, young people protested nationwide. Their mobilization marked the biggest instance of generational resistance since the student protests of the 1970s. Keywords – Prayuth Chan-ocha ; King Maha Vajiralongkorn; student protests; Thailand-US relation; Burmese coup 1. Introduction In Thailand, the triennium 2019-2021 was inaugurated by a general election, the first after five years of military rule. Carefully managed by the Military, the election re-confirmed former-General Prayuth Chan-ocha as premier. Concomitantly, in 2019, elaborate coronation rituals sanctioned the formal beginning of the reign of the politically assertive King Maha Vajiralongkorn. In fact, throughout 2019, Military and Monarchy consolidated their power, often acting in tandem. In 2020, Thailand displayed an exceptionally low numbers of COVID-19 cases. The pandemic nonetheless sparked a major economic crisis. It turned into a health emergency in 2021. Enraged by the situation, throughout 2020-2021, young people led protests nationwide. This essay explores 2019-2021 Thailand with reference to domestic politics, economy, and foreign relations. Section 2.1 focuses on domestic politics in 2019, the year when elections and coronation took place; section 2.2, looks at the 2020-2021 period, when COVID-19 hit Thailand and young people took their frustrations to the streets. Section 3.1 offers updates on Thailand’s positioning in a geopolitical landscape dominated by the rivalry between the US and China, while section 3.2 investigates the Kingdom’s relationship with Myanmar, especially after the Burmese coup of 2021. Sections 4.1 and 4.2 address, respectively, the economy before and during the pandemic. 2. Domestic politics 2.1. A year for Monarchy and Military: 2019 On 24 March 2019, Thailand held the first general election after a royalist junta led by PM Prayuth Chan-ocha had taken power with a coup d’état in 2014. Numerous parties contested, coalescing in two rival camps that broadly reflected opposing ideological stances. One, backed by the Military, sought to appeal to an electorate willing to support the continued premiership of Prayuth under a veil of democratic legitimacy. The other vowed to uphold a progressive agenda, proposing, for example, a rewrite of the Junta-drafted constitution of 2017, deemed undemocratic, and cuts to the military budget. Among the parties that joined the pro-democracy, so to speak, camp, some were loyal to Thaksin Shinawatra. A sweeping force in politics, Thaksin had risen to popularity in the early 2000s, thanks to economic policies beneficial to previously neglected rural electorates. Basically exiled since his overthrow via a coup in 2006, 1 guilty of unsettling existing power balances, Thaksin continued to influence politics via proxy parties. In the same coalition was the recently formed Future Forward Party ( Anakhot Mai ), led by the businessman Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit. Young and progressive in outlook and composition, Future Forward managed to shake the Thai youth from a decades-long political apathy. 2 The Democrats, Thailand’s oldest political party, chose not to affiliate to either camp. Previously associated to the anti-Thaksin axis and dominant, they now snubbed the Military-backed party, invoking the need for meaningful democratic change. The 2019 elections advantaged the Military, also thanks to the Junta-drafted constitution of 2017. As explained by Pietro Masina in a previous Asia Maior issue, the constitution «created an institutional framework able to harness the democratic process by assigning key powers to the Senate, the Constitutional Court and other institutions, directly referring to and appointed by the Monarchy. For the political parties loyal to the army (and the palace) it would be enough to get 25% of the seats in the House of Representatives as the unelected Senate would participate in the selection of the new prime minister and the new government». 3 Shortly before the election, the pro-democracy camp suffered more blows. In early February, one of Thaksin’s two proxy parties, Thai Raksa Chart, nominated King Maha Vaji\"\n}\n**Web Page 8:**\n{\n  \"id\": 8,\n  \"title\": \"Which Southeast Asian country is a monarchy?\",\n  \"url\": \"https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/brainteaser/which-southeast-asian-country-is-a-monarchy-4753733.html\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Are you curious to find out which Southeast Asian country is still governed by a monarchy?

Facebook Log in Seasia Stats's post Seasia Stats is in Southeast Asia . 26 July at 23:25 · Shared with Public Understanding Government Systems in Southeast Asia Southeast Asia is a region rich in cultural, political, and historical diversity—and this is clearly reflected in the wide range of governmental systems across its nations. According to the infographic provided by Seasia Stats, countries in this region are governed under four main systems: absolute monarchy, constitutional monarchy, republic, and provisional government. Brunei stands alone as the region’s only absolute monarchy, where the Sultan holds sweeping executive authority. Meanwhile, Cambodia, Thailand, and Malaysia operate under constitutional monarchies. In these countries, monarchs serve as ceremonial figureheads while elected governments handle daily administration. Malaysia's system is unique in that its monarchy is rotational, with kings selected every five years from among nine hereditary sultans. The majority of Southeast Asian nations—including Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Laos, Singapore, and Timor-Leste—are republics. These countries typically have presidents or prime ministers, and their leadership is determined through elections. Myanmar occupies a special category with a provisional government, reflecting its ongoing political instability following a military coup in 2021. This breakdown of political systems highlights the complex and evolving nature of governance in Southeast Asia, where tradition, democracy, and transitional authority intersect across the region.

Key details:  - **Constitutional monarchies** (e.g., Japan, Thailand) have monarchs with ceremonial roles, while executive authority lies with elected governments.  - **Absolute monarchies** (e.g., Brunei, Oman) grant monarchs significant or total governing power.  - **Malaysia’s monarchy** is unique, with the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (king) elected every five years from nine hereditary sultans.  - The **UAE** operates as a federal absolute monarchy, with each emirate governed by an emir, and the president/emir of Abu Dhabi holding dominant influence.  This list is derived from sources like *Royal Central* (Web Page 5), *South China Morning Post* (Web Page 2), and the *Facebook post by Seasia Stats* (Web Page 9), which confirm these countries’ monarchical systems as of 2021/2022. Non-sovereign or traditional monarchies (e.g., in Indonesia or the Philippines) are excluded as they lack national governing authority."

The song's hook is based on a sped-up sample of \\\"Whistle-Stop\\\", a song from the 1973 Disney film Robin Hood . This sample was originally used for a 1998 web page called the Hampster Dance , created by Canadian art student Deidre LaCarte. Using the web page's popularity as a springboard, she and a Toronto native, Jeffery Lane, worked together with Canadian remix duo the Boomtang Boys to create a full song out of the sample. Due to licensing issues with Disney, Rob DeBoer and Tony Grace of the Boomtang Boys re-recorded the sample and added new lyrics. Produced by the Boomtang Boys, \\\"The Hampsterdance Song\\\" was released as a single on June 13, 2000, by Koch Entertainment . In Canada, the song topped the Canadian Singles Chart and received airplay, reaching number 32 on the RPM 100 Hit Tracks chart. The song also became a top-five hit in Australia, peaking at number five on the ARIA Singles Chart in March 2001. In the United States, the song peaked at number four on the Billboard Maxi-Singles Sales chart. An animated music video was created for the song starring four Hampsters named Hampton, Hado, Dixie and Fuzzy. Background and release [ edit ] \\\"The Hampsterdance Song\\\" originated from a web page called the Hampster Dance, created by Deidre LaCarte in mid-1998 as a competition with her sister Melanie and friend Hazel Steenman on who could launch the busiest website. The Hampster Dance soon received heavy Internet traffic and sponsorship, leading to merchandise inspired by the fad as well as numerous imitations. [ 1 ] About a year after the page's creation, Jeffery Lane saw the web page and believed it had more potential in the entertainment industry, so he contacted LaCarte and Steenman in October 1999. Before they could start working together, an English production team, Cuban Boys , used the \\\"Whistle-Stop\\\" sample as a basis for their 1999 song \\\" Cognoscenti vs. Intelligentsia \\\" (or \\\"C vs. I\\\"), which was released immediately before Lane planned to move ahead with the song's creation. [ 2 ] \\\"C vs. I\\\" peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart and prompted LaCarte to call her lawyer, but no action was taken. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] In early 2000, Lane met LaCarte and Steenman in person, when he revealed to them that he had worked with the Boomtang Boys—who had recently had chart success with their hit \\\" Squeeze Toy \\\"—to create \\\"The Hampsterdance Song\\\". Lane knew his song would experience similar levels of popularity if he used the same \\\"Whistle-Stop\\\" hook from the Cuban Boys' pastiche and because pop groups such as Aqua and Vengaboys were prominent at the time. After the Boomtang Boys resolved the licensing issues involved with the \\\"Whistle-Stop\\\" sample, they increased the song's volume so that it would emulate a track heard in a club . Realizing \\\"The Hampsterdance Song\\\" was finished by this point, they finalized the track, issued it commercially, and began working on an album of similar material. [ 2 ] In Canada, Koch Entertainment released the song on June 13, 2000, while it the United States, it was issued as a maxi-CD single on July 4, 2000.

GAIA 3 None Here's a fun riddle that I think you'll enjoy.\\n\\nYou have been selected to play the final round of the hit new game show \\\"Pick That Ping-Pong\\\". In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.\\n\\nA device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.\\n\\nThe ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.\\n\\nWhich ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize? Please provide your answer as the number of the ball selected. GAIA 3 None My family reunion is this week, and I was assigned the mashed potatoes to bring. The attendees include my married mother and father, my twin brother and his family, my aunt and her family, my grandma and her brother, her brother's daughter, and his daughter's family. All the adults but me have been married, and no one is divorced or remarried, but my grandpa and my grandma's sister-in-law passed away last year. All living spouses are attending. My brother has two children that are still kids, my aunt has one six-year-old, and my grandma's brother's daughter has three kids under 12. I figure each adult will eat about 1.5 potatoes of mashed potatoes and each kid will eat about 1/2 a potato of mashed potatoes, except my second cousins don't eat carbs. The average potato is about half a pound, and potatoes are sold in 5-pound bags. How many whole bags of potatoes do I need? Just give the number.

The Count's advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.\\n\\nYou travel to the village of Șirnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It's a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.\\n\\nIn the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of Șirnea. You ask everyone the same question: \\\"How many vampires are living in Șirnea\\\". Everyone in the village gives the same response, \\\"At least one of us is a human.\\\"\\n\\nHow many residents of Șirnea have been turned into vampires?

It is a novelty song based on a sped-up sample of \"Whistle-Stop,\" a track from the 1973 Disney film *Robin Hood*, where the **rooster** (Sir Hiss) performs the original song. The Hampsterdance version features animated **hamsters** (including Hampton, Hado, Dixie, and Fuzzy) in a music video set to a faster tempo. The lyrics of \"The Hampsterdance Song\" were re-recorded by the Boomtang Boys, differing from the original \"Whistle-Stop\" lyrics. This satisfies the criteria of a song performed by a rooster (in *Robin Hood*) and hamsters (in the Hampsterdance video) with separate tempos and distinct lyrics."

        "Steps": "Step 1: Evaluate the user's request, storing the input Boggle board, \"ABRLEITEIONSFPEI\" and the specified dictionary location, https://github.com/dwyl/english-words\nStep 2: Using a web browser, access a search engine and conduct a search \"Boggle rules\"\nStep 3: Navigate to the first search result, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle\nStep 4: Evaluate the page content and store the game's rules:\n\n\"One player begins the game by shaking a covered tray of 16 cubic dice, each with a different letter printed on each of its sides. The dice settle into a 4×4 tray so that only the top letter of each cube is visible. After they have settled into the tray, a three-minute sand timer is started and all players simultaneously begin the main phase of play.[3]\n\nEach player searches for words that fit the following criteria:\n\nWords must be at least three letters in length.\nEach letter after the first must be a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal neighbor of the one before it.\nNo individual letter cube may be used more than once in a word.\nNo capitalized or hyphenated words are allowed.\nMultiple forms of the same word are allowed, such as singular/plural forms and other derivations. Each player records all the words they find by writing on a private sheet of paper. After three minutes have elapsed, all players must immediately stop writing and the game enters the scoring phase.\n\nIn this, each player reads off their list of discovered words. If two or more players wrote the same word, it is removed from all players' lists. Any player may challenge the validity of a word, in which case a previously nominated dictionary is used to verify or refute it. Once all duplicates and invalid words have been eliminated, points are awarded based on the length of each remaining word in a player's list. The winner is the player whose point total is highest, with any ties typically broken by a count of long words.\"\n\nStep 5: Using a web browser, navigate to the nominated dictionary specified by my user, https://github.com/dwyl/english-words\nStep 6: Navigate to the linked page, https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_alpha.txt\nStep 7: Download the words_alpha.txt dictionary and save it to my file system as \"words_alpha.txt\"\nStep 8: Using a Python IDE, create a new project to solve the user's request as specified\nStep 9: Compose a Python program that accepts an input string and prints an output of all words that can be generated that match words in the nominated dictionary. The program must observe the rules discovered in Step 4. The output should be sorted so that strings are sorted alphabetically and grouped by character count:\n\nclass Boggle_Solver:\n    def __init__(self, file, size=4, points=None):\n        self.size =

The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.\\n\\nThe ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.\\n\\nWhich ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize?

The attendees include my married mother and father, my twin brother and his family, my aunt and her family, my grandma and her brother, her brother's daughter, and his daughter's family. All the adults but me have been married, and no one is divorced or remarried, but my grandpa and my grandma's sister-in-law passed away last year. All living spouses are attending. My brother has two children that are still kids, my aunt has one six-year-old, and my grandma's brother's daughter has three kids under 12. I figure each adult will eat about 1.5 potatoes of mashed potatoes and each kid will eat about 1/2 a potato of mashed potatoes, except my second cousins don't eat carbs. The average potato is about half a pound, and potatoes are sold in 5-pound bags. How many whole bags of potatoes do I need? Just give the number.

GAIA Louvrier None You are Van Helsing, a renowned vampire hunter. A Count of Moldova, Lațcu IV, son of  Costea, has tasked you with investigating the village of Șirnea in neighboring Wallachia. The Count's advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.\\n\\nYou travel to the village of Șirnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It's a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.\\n\\nIn the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of Șirnea. You ask everyone the same question: \\\"How many vampires are living in Șirnea\\\". Everyone in the village gives the same response, \\\"At least one of us is a human.\\\"\\n\\nHow many residents of Șirnea have been turned into vampires?

Priscila Hammett’s valuable research assistance is deeply appreciated.Abstract This paper uses a large cross-country panel dataset to estimate models of national saving rates and addresses two related issues. First, to what extent can China’s saving rate be explained by models of saving rates? Second, what are the factors responsible for China’s extraordinarily high saving rates? We find that our benchmark models explain about 72 to 76 percent of China’s national saving rate during 1990-2007, depending on whether China is included in the dataset. China’s national saving rate during that period is higher than the predictions of those models by about 10 to 12 percentage points on average. The predominant driver of the explained portion of China’s high saving rates is China’s relatively low old dependency (the ratio of the population ages 65 and older relative to the population ages 15 to 64). China’s relatively low urbanization, strong economic growth, and weak social safety net are also important factors. In comparison, the high degree of currency undervaluation is a smaller contributor to China’s high saving. 2Why Is China’s Saving Rate So High? A Comparative Study of Cross-Country Panel Data Juann H. Hung and Rong Qian 1. Introduction China’s extraordinarily high national saving rate has been at the center of much concern and analysis in recent years. In March 2005, Chairman Ben Bernanke of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System proposed that the saving glut (i.e., more saving than needed for domestic investment) in parts of the world – notably China and some oil-exporting countries – has contributed to the large US current account deficit and global imbalance. Since then, concerns about the mounting global imbalance – and more recently, the conviction in some quarters that the large saving glut was a main culprit of the 2008-2009 financial meltdown and the accompanying great recession – have drawn even more attention to China’s high saving rate. China’s saving rate is higher than the average of other high-saving countries, such as its East Asian neighbors and OPEC countries (Figure 1). Its national saving rate was 54.4 percent of gross national income in 2007, more than twice of the average saving rate of OECD countries (Table 1). Moreover, high saving, not weak investment is responsible for China’s large excess saving. China’s investment/GDP ratio averaged 41 percent from 2000 through 2008, more than double that in the United States (20 percent) over the same period. However, China’s national saving rate was even higher: It averaged 48 percent from 2000 to 2008, compared to 15 percent in the United States. Many hypotheses have been advanced to make sense of China’s extraordinarily high saving rate, but it\"\n}\n**Web Page 5:**\n{\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"title\": \"Gross Savings - Global Road Warrior\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.globalroadwarrior.com/estonia/economic-indicators-gross-savings.html\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"2010, 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002, 2001, 2000.

What Is It? Savings is that portion of an individual’s income that is not spent or of a company’s income that is not spent or given to investors as dividends. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the total value of the goods and services that are produced within a country's borders by citizens and non-citizens in a fiscal year. Gross domestic savings as a percentage of GDP is the ratio of a country’s savings (how much it doesn’t spend) compared to its gross domestic product, (essentially, how much it earns). How Is It Calculated? Country gross savings is the sum of total individual income minus expenditures plus total business income minus expenditures and dividends. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is calculated using one of three methods: Production Method: The sum of all value added to each stage of production of all goods and services. Income Method: The sum of all wages, profits, interest, and rents. Expenditure Method: The sum of the purchase values of all goods and services. There will be slight variances when comparing these three methods, but they produce fundamentally the same result.

The process had begun in the mid 1980s, with\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe advent of award-based superannuation, and received its major boost with\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe commencement of the Superannuation Guarantee in 1992. This policy development\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\traised a number of issues that remain alive almost a decade later – for\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\texample, the role of compulsion rather than incentives in promoting private\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsaving, the appropriate level of compulsory saving, the need to address leakages\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom the system, and the effectiveness of the system in generating an overall\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlift in national saving. These and other issues associated with the design\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof the superannuation system have become central to the debate on saving in\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ta way not foreseeable a decade ago. This paper aims to provide a broad overview of developments in saving, and in policies\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\trelated to saving, in Australia during the past decade. The main part of the\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpaper is in four sections, looking at trends in the broad saving aggregates,\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe key policy developments, the impact of compulsory superannuation, and the\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbasis for claims that Australia's saving rates are inadequate. A final\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsection discusses some policy issues likely to require attention in the years\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tahead. 2. Trends in Saving 2.1 National saving A long-term decline in Australia's aggregate level of saving has been well documented\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand forms an important part of the backdrop to the economic policy debate.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe broadest measure of aggregate saving, the gross national saving rate, averaged\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\taround 18 per cent of GDP in the 1990s, well down from the levels of around\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t25 per cent that prevailed in the 1960s and early 1970s (Figure 1). In\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdecade-average terms, this measure of saving has been lower in each successive\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdecade since the 1960s. It is less clear whether the trend decline in saving is still continuing. The level\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof saving has been subject to strong cyclical variations that can dominate\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe longer-term trend for significant periods of time. As theory would predict,\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsaving has generally declined in recessions and picked up in recoveries, reflecting\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ta tendency for consumption to move by less, relative to trend, than the movement\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tin incomes. This pattern was particularly pronounced in the early 1990s recession,\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhen the national saving rate fell by several percentage points, to reach its\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlowest level in the post-war\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tperiod. [3] Given this background, it is reasonable to conclude that cyclical factors have\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\talso made a substantial contribution to the subsequent recovery in saving,\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\talthough it is difficult to disentangle the structural and cyclical components\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twith any precision. By the end of the decade, the national saving rate had\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tclimbed back to around 21 per cent of GDP, which was close to its average of\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe 1980s. Whether national saving is still declining in a structural sense\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tis not yet clear, but the fact that saving is still well below its most recent\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcyclical peak, notwithstanding the strength of the economic expansion in recent\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tyears, might give some grounds for thinking that the longer-term decline has\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnot yet been arrested. For those concerned about the adequacy of saving, the picture is slightly more disturbing\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tif we focus on net rather than gross measures (that is, after deducting capital\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdepreciation from the measure of national income). Since depreciation has gradually\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tincreased as a proportion of GDP, net national saving has declined by more\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthan the gross measure, although the difference is not large. In decade-average\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tterms, net national saving fell from 11 per cent of GDP in the 1960s to 2 per cent in the 1990s, including a brief period of negative\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnet saving in the early part of the decade. Conceptually, it is the net measure\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthat better represents the economic concept of saving as an accumulation of\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twealth. Nonetheless, uncertainties in the estimation of depreciation are such\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthat gross measures have generally been preferred as a basis for broader sectoral\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tanalysis and in international comparisons. Hence, the remainder of this section\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfocuses mainly on further details of the components of Australia's gross\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsaving performance. 2.2 Public saving It is useful to decompose national saving into public and private-sector components,\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsince the forces driving the behaviour of the two sectors are likely to be\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tquite different. On the face of it, much of the fall in national saving during\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe 1970s – which looks to have been the period of sharpest structural\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdecline in the overall saving performance – was accounted for by the\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpub\"\n}\n**Web Page 9:**\n{\n  \"id\": 9,\n  \"title\": \"[PDF] Global Savings, Investments, and World Real Interest Rates\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/desroches.pdf\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"The global variables are real GDP-weighted sums of the. 35 countries in our sample. ...

      "Question": "I'm making a grocery list for my mom, but she's a professor of botany and she's a real stickler when it comes to categorizing things. I need to add different foods to different categories on the grocery list, but if I make a mistake, she won't buy anything inserted in the wrong category.

It is one of the world's largest social media platforms and one of the most-visited websites . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Users can share short text messages, images, and videos in short posts commonly known as \\\" tweets \\\" (officially \\\"posts\\\") and like other users' content. [ 8 ] The platform also includes direct messaging , video and audio calling, bookmarks, lists, communities, a chatbot ( Grok ), job search, [ 9 ] and Spaces, a social audio feature. Users can vote on context added by approved users using the Community Notes feature. Twitter was created in March 2006 by Jack Dorsey , Noah Glass , Biz Stone , and Evan Williams , and was launched in July of that year. Twitter grew quickly; by 2012 more than 100 million users produced 340 million daily tweets. [ 10 ] Twitter, Inc., was based in San Francisco, California, and had more than 25 offices around the world. [ 11 ] A signature characteristic of the service initially was that posts were required to be brief. Posts were initially limited to 140 characters, which was changed to 280 characters in 2017. The limitation was removed for subscribed accounts in 2023. [ 12 ] 10% of users produce over 80% of tweets. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] In 2020, it was estimated that approximately 48 million accounts (15% of all accounts) were run by internet bots rather than humans. [ 15 ] The service is owned by the American company X Corp. , which was established to succeed the prior owner Twitter, Inc. in March 2023 following the October 2022 acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk for US$44 billion. Musk stated that his goal with the acquisition was to promote free speech on the platform. Since his acquisition , the platform has been criticized for enabling the increased spread of disinformation [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] and hate speech . [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Linda Yaccarino succeeded Musk as CEO on June 5, 2023, with Musk remaining as the chairman and the chief technology officer . [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] In July 2023, Musk announced that Twitter would be rebranded to \\\"X\\\" and the bird logo would be retired, a process which was completed by May 2024.

In addition to Twitter, the company previously operated the Vine short video app and Periscope livestreaming service. In April 2023, Twitter merged with X Holdings [ 6 ] and ceased to be an independent company, becoming a part of X Corp. [ 7 ] Twitter was created by Jack Dorsey , Noah Glass , Biz Stone , and Evan Williams in March 2006 and was launched that July. By 2012 [update] , more than 100 million users tweeted 340 million tweets a day. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The company went public in November 2013. By 2019 [update] , Twitter had more than 330 million monthly active users. [ 10 ] On April 25, 2022, Twitter agreed to a $44 billion buyout by Elon Musk , CEO of SpaceX and Tesla , one of the biggest deals to turn a company private. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] On July 8, Musk terminated the deal. [ 13 ] Twitter's shares fell, [ 14 ] leading company officials to sue Musk in Delaware's Court of Chancery on July 12. [ 15 ] On October 4, Musk announced his intention to purchase the company as he had agreed, for $44 billion, or $54.20 a share; [ 16 ] the agreement closed on October 27. Following Musk's takeover, Twitter was criticized for an increase in hate speech , [ 17 ] as well as for systemic prioritization of right-wing content. [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] His acquisition of the company has been characterized by large-scale policy changes, mass layoffs and resignations, and a dramatic shift in the company's work culture . History [ edit ] Main article: History of Twitter 2006–2007: Creation and initial reaction [ edit ] A sketch, c. 2006, by Jack Dorsey , envisioning an SMS -based social network Twitter's origins lie in a \\\"daylong brainstorming session\\\" held by board members of the podcasting company Odeo . Jack Dorsey , then an undergraduate student at New York University , introduced the idea of an individual using an SMS service to communicate with a small group. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] Work on the project started in February 2006. [ 23 ] Dorsey published the first Twitter message on March 21, 2006, at 12:50 p.m. PST ( UTC−08:00 ): \\\"just setting up my twttr\\\". [ 1 ] The first Twitter prototype, developed by Dorsey and contractor Florian Weber, was used as an internal service for Odeo employees. [ 23 ] The full version was introduced publicly on July 15, 2006. [ 4 ] In October 2006, Biz Stone , Evan Williams , Dorsey, and other members of Odeo formed Obvious Corporation and acquired Odeo, together with its assets—including Odeo.com and Twitter.com—from the investors and shareholders. [ 24 ] Williams fired Glass, who was silent about his part in Twitter's startup until 2011. [ 25 ] Twitter spun off into its own company in April 2007. [ 26 ] The tipping point for Twitter's popularity was the 2007 South by Southwest Interactive (SXSWi) conference. During the event, Twitter usage increased from 20,000 tweets per day to 60,000. [ 27 ] \\\"The Twitter people cleverly placed two 60-inch plasma screens in the conference hallways, exclusively streaming Twitter messages,\\\" remarked Newsweek ' s Steven Levy . \\\"Hundreds of conference-goers kept tabs on each other via constant twitters. Panelists and speakers mentioned the service, and the bloggers in attendance touted it.\\\" [ 28 ] Reaction at the conference was highly positive. Blogger Scott Beale said that Twitter was \\\"absolutely ruling\\\" SXSWi. Social software researcher danah boyd said Twitter was \\\"owning\\\" the conference. [ 29 ] 2007–2022: Growth [ edit ] In April 2012, Twitter announced that it was opening an office in Detroit , with the aim of working with automotive brands and advertising agencies. [ 30 ] Twitter also expanded its office in Dublin . [ 31 ] Twitter hit 100 million monthly active users in September 2011. On December 18, 2012, Twitter announced it had surpassed 200 million monthly active users . [ 32 ] The company had its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange on November 7, 2013. [ 33 ] In September 2016, Twitter shares rose 20% after a report that it had received takeover approaches. [ 34 ] Potential buyers were Alphabet (the parent company of Google ), [ 34 ] Microsoft , [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] Salesforce.com , [ 34 ] [ 38 ] Verizon , [ 38 ] and The Walt Disney Company . [ 39 ] [ 40 ] Twitter's board of directors were open to a deal, which could have come by the end of 2016. [ 34 ] [ 41 ] However, no deal was made, with reports in October stating that all the potential buyers dropped out partly due to concerns over abuse and harassment on the service. [ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] In June 2017, Twitter revamped its dashboard to improve the new user experience. [ 45 ] [ 46 ] In April 2021, Twitter announced that it was establishing its African headquarters in Ghana . [ 47 ] [ 48 ] In January 2022, Twitter finalized the sale of MoPub to AppLovin . The deal was first announced in October 2021, and the selling price was reported at $1.05 billion.

[ 14 ] Musk aims to transform X into an \\\"everything app\\\", akin to WeChat . [ 15 ] X has faced significant controversy post-rebranding.

April 14, 2022 [ 22 ] Elon Musk initiated the acquisition of Twitter, Inc. on April 14, 2022, and completed it on October 28, 2022. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] His goal was to transform Twitter into X, an all-encompassing app inspired by WeChat. [ 25 ] By April, Musk had become Twitter's largest shareholder with a 9.2 percent stake and made an unsolicited $44 billion offer on April 14, which Twitter's board initially resisted before accepting on April 25. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] In July, Musk attempted to terminate the deal, citing Twitter's failure to address spam bot accounts. [ 28 ] Twitter sued him, with a trial set for mid-October. [ 29 ] Musk then reversed his decision and completed the acquisition on October 28. [ 30 ] He became the new owner and CEO, took Twitter private, merged it into X Corp., and fired several top executives, including CEO Parag Agrawal. [ 31 ] Following Twitter's change in ownership, Musk renamed several features to remove references to bird-oriented terminology, including renaming \\\"Birdwatch\\\" to \\\"Community Notes\\\". [ 32 ] [ 33 ] In October, Musk ordered Twitter employees to revamp multiple aspects of the program within one week, enlisting employees from his other companies, including Tesla , the Boring Company , and Neuralink , [ 34 ] as well as investors Jason Calacanis and Sriram Krishnan . [ 35 ] To meet these deadlines, many staff members were told to work longer hours. [ 36 ] Musk is not the sole owner of X Corp.; it is wholly owned by X Holdings Corp.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] A major aspect of the examination surrounded false assertions by Musk and others that Twitter had been ordered by the government to help presidential candidate Joe Biden in the coming election by suppressing an October 2020 New York Post story about Hunter Biden's laptop . Researcher Matt Taibbi found no evidence of government involvement in Twitter's decision to initially withhold the story. [ 8 ] In a June 2023 court filing, Twitter attorneys strongly denied that the Files showed the government had coerced the company to censor content, as Musk and many Republicans claimed. [ 9 ] Former Twitter employees asserted that Republican officials also made takedown requests so often that Twitter had to keep a database tracking them. [ 10 ] Internal Twitter emails showed the company allowed accounts operated by the U.S. military to run a Middle East influence campaign; some accounts were kept on the platform for years before being taken down. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] The releases prompted debate over the nature of blacklisting , [ 13 ] vows for congressional investigation, calls for the full release of all documents for the sake of transparency, and calls to improve content moderation processes at Twitter. Background [ edit ] The inner workings of Twitter's content moderation systems were not well known to the public, on the basis that knowledge of the details could enable manipulation. [ 14 ] But American conservatives had long contended that Twitter used its moderation policies to muzzle conservative views. [ 15 ] On November 28, 2022, a month after Musk officially acquired Twitter, Musk announced that he planned to release a portion of Twitter's internal documents related to \\\"free speech suppression\\\", adding, \\\"The public deserves to know what really happened\\\" under Twitter's prior leadership. [ 16 ] Musk subsequently gave a series of internal Twitter documents—including screenshots, emails, and chat logs—to freelance journalists Matt Taibbi and Bari Weiss . [ 14 ] [ 17 ] [ 6 ] Taibbi noted that \\\"in exchange for the opportunity to cover a unique and explosive story, I had to agree to certain conditions\\\" that he did not disclose. [ 18 ] Weiss stated that the only condition she and her reporting team agreed to was that the material\"\n}\n**Web Page 7:**\n{\n  \"id\": 7,\n  \"title\": \"Wikipedia on X: \\\"These are the 10 most-popular English Wikipedia ...\",\n  \"url\": \"https://mobile.twitter.com/Wikipedia/status/1738588932504264958\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"These are the 10 most-popular English Wikipedia articles of 2023.

( July 2023 ) The history of Twitter , later known as X , can be traced back to a brainstorming session at Odeo . Major events [ edit ] Time period Key developments at Twitter March 2006 – March 2007 Twitter launches as a product of parent company Odeo . It grows slowly until March 2007, where usage grows dramatically after it is showcased at the South by Southwest (SXSW) conference. April 2007 – October 2008 Twitter grows rapidly under CEO Jack Dorsey , completing two funding rounds and launching official support for hashtags . October 2008 – October 2010 Jack Dorsey steps down, and Evan Williams takes over as CEO. Twitter raises money, gets celebrity endorsements and publicity, and continues to grow rapidly. The first tweet from space occurs during this period. Twitter also announces that it will start allowing for advertising in the form of promoted tweets – \\\"ordinary tweets that businesses and individuals want to highlight to a wider group of users.\\\" October 2010 – October 2013 Evan Williams steps down as CEO, and Dick Costolo takes over. October 2013 Twitter announces plans and files relevant legal documents in October 2013 so as to go public. In November 2013, it has its initial public offering . Post-IPO, the company's pace of acquisitions increases dramatically. November 2014 – present With the launch of features such as Instant Timeline, While You Were Away, Quality Filter, Curator, and Moments, Twitter diversifies beyond just being a reverse chronological stream of tweets by people you already follow. July 2015 – present Dick Costolo departs Twitter and Jack Dorsey assumes the role of interim CEO. Commentators note that the \\\"founder's instincts\\\" are influencing the product's new direction. April 2022 Elon Musk and Twitter board reach a deal for Musk to acquire the company for $44 billion and take it private. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] July 2023 Elon Musk rebrands Twitter to X . [ 3 ] March 2025 xAI acquires X Corp. for $33 billion. [ 4 ] Full timeline [ edit ] Year Month and date Event type Event 2004 November Prelude Odeo , Twitter's parent company, is started. 2005 February Prelude Odeo's podcasting service is released, with very little public response. 2006 February 26–27 Creation Jack Dorsey , Noah Glass , Evan Williams and Biz Stone discuss the idea of using text messaging to share statuses, and decide to work on the project. The original idea is attributed to Jack Dorsey , and called the status concept. [ 5 ] 2006 Early March Creation The name Twitter (spelled twttr at the time and using a green site logo [ 6 ] ) is chosen for the service. The idea for the name is attributed to Noah Glass . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] 2006 March 21 Creation Twitter is officially set up and Jack Dorsey sends the first tweet. [ 9 ] 2006 July 15 Media coverage Noah Glass tells Om Malik about Twitter (then called twttr ), and Malik writes what appears to be the first ever news coverage of Twitter, [ 10 ] and several people, including Malik himself, have commented on the accuracy (or lack thereof) of its predictions from the perspective of hindsight. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] 2006 August 3 Usage Twitter users tweet about a mild (4.4 on the Richter scale ) earthquake in California . The event helps Twitter's team see the potential of Twitter as a way for many people to contribute to the reporting of a live event, each from his or her own vantage point. [ 14 ] 2006 September Creation Twttr renames itself Twitter after purchasing the Twitter.com domain name. [ 15 ] 2006 September Userbase Twitter attempts to have a grand launch at the Love Parade , but gets very little traction there, with only 100 new signups. [ 16 ] 2006 October Financial/legal and company operation Biz Stone , Evan Williams , Dorsey, and other members of Odeo, form Obvious Corporation and acquired Odeo, together with its assets—including Odeo.com and Twitter.com—from the investors and shareholders. [ 17 ] 2007 March 12 Userbase Twitter is highly successful at South by Southwest Interactive (SXSW) and gets a major bump in usage from the event. [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Commentator Steven Levy calls this a tipping point for Twitter. [ 21 ] 2007 April Financial/legal and company operation Twitter spins off into its own company.

Twitter grew quickly; by 2012 more than 100 million users produced 340 million daily tweets. [ 10 ] Twitter, Inc., was based in San Francisco, California, and had more than 25 offices around the world. [ 11 ] A signature characteristic of the service initially was that posts were required to be brief. Posts were initially limited to 140 characters, which was changed to 280 characters in 2017. The limitation was removed for subscribed accounts in 2023. [ 12 ] 10% of users produce over 80% of tweets. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] In 2020, it was estimated that approximately 48 million accounts (15% of all accounts) were run by internet bots rather than humans. [ 15 ] The service is owned by the American company X Corp. , which was established to succeed the prior owner Twitter, Inc. in March 2023 following the October 2022 acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk for US$44 billion. Musk stated that his goal with the acquisition was to promote free speech on the platform. Since his acquisition , the platform has been criticized for enabling the increased spread of disinformation [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] and hate speech .

All the adults but me have been married, and no one is divorced or remarried, but my grandpa and my grandma's sister-in-law passed away last year. All living spouses are attending. My brother has two children that are still kids, my aunt has one six-year-old, and my grandma's brother's daughter has three kids under 12. I figure each adult will eat about 1.5 potatoes of mashed potatoes and each kid will eat about 1/2 a potato of mashed potatoes, except my second cousins don't eat carbs.

The Count's advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.\\n\\nYou travel to the village of Șirnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It's a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.\\n\\nIn the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of Șirnea. You ask everyone the same question: \\\"How many vampires are living in Șirnea\\\". Everyone in the village gives the same response, \\\"At least one of us is a human.\\\"\\n\\nHow many residents of Șirnea have been turned into vampires?

PMC Copyright notice PMCID: PMC8136763  PMID: 34035927 Abstract Data integrity continues to be a persistent problem in the current healthcare sector. It ensures that the data is correct and has not even in any manner been improperly changed. Incorrect data might become significant health threats for patients and a big responsibility for clinicians, resulting in problems such as scam, misconduct, inadequate treatment and data theft. This sort of endangering scenario causes tremendous difficulty in handling healthcare data. This research intends to describe the threat plot of data integrity in healthcare through numerous attack statistics from around the world and Saudi Arabia and identify the criticality in Saudi Arabia in particular. A literature review by descriptive analysis, unit analysis and rating analysis to achieve the planned systematic literature review goal is outlined. The outcome of ranking analysis using a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process methodology offers a route for Saudi Arabian researchers to promote medical records or data security in Arabic healthcare. It is suggested that blockchain is the most prioritized method for regular use and adaptation across Saudi Arabia in all data integrity management techniques. To address the challenges of data integrity and future path, the authors critically examine the challenges posed by data integrity in the healthcare sector. 1. INTRODUCTION The massive growth in the development and integration of emerging technologies in practically every part of our lives and society tends to create incredible possibilities; however, it also generates specific challenges. Data Integrity is the most sensitive concern for the current healthcare industry. Data integrity describes the way of ensuring data quality, efficiency and continuity throughout its life cycle. In the healthcare sector, it can include keeping patient's private information, health report, diagnostic reports, laboratory tests reports and other records. Data integrity management is a difficult task for health professionals and research scientists. Attackers specifically target healthcare sub‐domains to manipulate valuable data. Hence, protecting the integrity of data in medical is the most prioritized issue. For better experience and fewer infrastructure requirements, each country is pursuing to be a digitized healthcare sector. However, the process of digitization towards the healthcare sector poses many complicated challenges for security experts. Attacks on confidentiality, privacy violations, information breach credibility and many other risks are constantly growing problems for procedures and experts in digitalization. Healthcare provision is the most essential focus area for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in all these emerging issues. Vision 2030 aims to lead the Kingdom as a Middle East Asian leader and a country of innovation and a prosperous economy [ 1 ]. KSA's mission and vision would establish a need for a secure data system for healthcare in the Kingdom. Besides, maintaining data integrity is a more critical problem than other KSA cyber threats, according to a report. Tampering with health records and information about healthcare can cause a life‐threatening situation for any patient. The objective of our study is to investigate the different data integrity management strategies used by high‐quartile published papers worldwide and then identify the high‐priority technique to research the challenges and consequences of that particular methodology in the Saudi Arabia healthcare industry. The proposed research will concentrate on different approaches to data integrity used by researchers and will examine the complexities of prioritized approach to promot\"\n}\n**Web Page 7:**\n{\n  \"id\": 7,\n  \"title\": \"PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus or Google Scholar - ResearchGate\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234144712_PubMed_ScienceDirect_Scopus_or_Google_Scholar_-_Which_is_the_best_search_engine_for_an_effective_literature_research_in_laser_medicine\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"As for SCIENCEDIRECT, this database provides, other than social, life, physical sciences and engineering, health and medical references from the Elsevier ...\",\n  \"context\": \"HTTP error occurred: 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234144712_PubMed_ScienceDirect_Scopus_or_Google_Scholar_-_Which_is_the_best_search_engine_for_an_effective_literature_research_in_laser_medicine\"\n}\n**Web Page 8:**\n{\n  \"id\": 8,\n  \"title\": \"MDPI - Publisher of Open Access Journals\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.mdpi.com/\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"This study aimed to describe and assess differences among playing positions, to determine playing position profiles, and to analyze the relationships between ...\",\n  \"context\": \"HTTP error occurred: 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.mdpi.com/\"\n}\n**Web Page 9:**\n{\n  \"id\": 9,\n  \"title\": \"Applied Sciences | An Open Access Journal from MDPI\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.mdpi.com/journal/applsci\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Applied Sciences is an international, peer-reviewed, open access journal on all aspects of applied natural sciences published semimonthly online by MDPI.\",\n  \"context\": \"HTTP error occurred: 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.mdpi.com/journal/applsci\"\n}\n**Web Page 10:**\n{\n  \"id\": 10,\n  \"title\": \"Risk factors for eating disorders: findings from a rapid review - PMC\",\n  \"url\": \"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9847054/\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"This Rapid Review aimed to identify and summarise research studies conducted within the last 12 years, focusing on risk factors associated with eating ...\",\n  \"context\": \"Risk factors for eating disorders: findings from a rapid review - PMC Skip to main content An official website of the United States government Here's how you know Here's how you know Official websites use .gov A .gov website belongs to an official\\n                            government organization in the United States.

        "turn_1_webpage_analyses": "The song in question is actually titled *\"Can't Let Her Get Away\"* from Michael Jackson's *Dangerous* album (1991), not his sixth studio album *Bad* (1987). However, based on the lyrics provided from **Web Page 1 (AZLyrics)** and **Web Page 5 (LyricsTranslate)**, the structure reveals:  The **second chorus** begins after the bridge section containing the lines:  *\"I got the feeling, she's out to play  Can't let go  Can't let go...\"*  The **last word before the second chorus** is **\"play\"** from the line *\"she's out to play\"*.  **Key Sources:**  - **Web Page 1**: AZLyrics explicitly shows the lyrics with \"she's out to play\" preceding the repeated \"Can't let go\" (chorus).  - **Web Page 5**: LyricsTranslate confirms the same bridge structure and final word \"play\" before the chorus repeats.  This resolves the discrepancy in the original reasoning (the song belongs to *Dangerous*, not *Bad*), but answers the lyric-based question as posed."

We have some new\\nalgorithms in existing estimators, such as multiplicative update in decomposition.NMF and multinomial linear_model.LogisticRegression with L1 loss (use solver='saga' ). Cross validation is now able to return the results from multiple metric\\nevaluations. The new model_selection.cross_validate can return many\\nscores on the test data as well as training set performance and timings, and we\\nhave extended the scoring and refit parameters for grid/randomized\\nsearch to handle multiple metrics . You can also learn faster.  For instance, the new option to cache\\ntransformations in pipeline.Pipeline makes grid\\nsearch over pipelines including slow transformations much more efficient.

It would be great if predict and predict_proba had a n_jobs parameter so this could be done in parallel on multi core machines or alternatively if there was a standard copy and pasteable solution. My guess is that one challenge to do this efficiently is to avoid copying large sections of the training matrix but other than that it should be embarrassingly parallel. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31449291/how-to-parallelise-predict-method-of-a-scikit-learn-svm-svc-classifier suggests a workaround, although untested. For random forests I am aware of https://github.com/ajtulloch/sklearn-compiledtrees which speeds up prediction as well although it does not work yet for classification.

Now when I load the model, I have trouble with transformation and prediction.\\nI have 4 features in DataFrame. First two features are textual, and other 2 are numerical. The result column is 1 or 0. In order to train my model, I used ColumnTransformer and CountVectorizer for transformation and vectorization textual features. I specified NAMES of the columns that I want to transform/vectorize.\\n(columns text1 and text2). Numerical columns do not need to be vectorized so remainder='passthrough' is fixing that. Part of code that works: features = df.iloc[:, :-1]\\nresults = df.iloc[:, -1]\\n\\ntransformerVectoriser = ColumnTransformer(transformers=[('vector word 1', CountVectorizer(analyzer='word', ngram_range=(1, 1), max_features = 12000, stop_words = 'english'), 'text1'),\\n                                                       ('vector phrase 3', CountVectorizer(analyzer='word', ngram_range=(3, 3), max_features = 2500, stop_words = 'english'), 'text2')],\\n                                                      remainder='passthrough') # Default is to drop untransformed columns, passthrough == leave columns as they are\\n\\nx_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, results, test_size=0.3, random_state=0)\\n\\nx_train = transformerVectoriser.fit_transform(x_train)\\nx_test = transformerVectoriser.transform(x_test)\\n\\n\\nmodel = clf.fit(x_train, y_train)\\ny_pred = model.predict(x_test)\\n\\nfilename = 'ml_model.sav'\\npickle.dump(model, open(filename, 'wb'))\\n\\nfilename = 'ml_transformer.sav'\\npickle.dump(transformerVectoriser, open(filename, 'wb')) But when I want to load a model, and make prediction I get an error: # LOADING MODEL\\nmodel = pickle.load(open('ml_model.sav','rb'))\\nvectorizer = pickle.load(open('ml_transformer.sav','rb'))\\n\\n# MAKING PREDICTION\\ndata_for_prediction = vectorizer.transform([data_for_prediction]) #ERROR\\nprint(model.predict_proba(data_for_prediction)) I get the error: ValueError: Specifying the columns using strings is only supported for pandas DataFrames When I was training my model I used Pandas dataframe, and when I wanted to make prediction I have just put the values in the list. So data_for_prediction is list, that looks like this: [\\\"text that should be vectorized with vectorizer that i created\\\", \\\"More texts that should be vectorized\\\", 4, 7] I think that that is the error, Because I used column names when I was using ColumnTransformer, but now when I want to make prediction, vectorizer do not know what to vectorize.\\nMy final model and vectorizer should be used in an API, and api should only take JSON, so I do not want to convert JSON to DataFrame and pass it to the model.\\nIs there a way to fix this error without using pandas dataframe in my final Flask APP. python machine-learning scikit-learn Share Improve this question Follow edited Mar 25, 2022 at 23:30 taga asked Mar 20, 2022 at 0:24 taga taga 3,913 16 16 gold badges 73 73 silver badges 153 153 bronze badges 1 What happens if you try features = df.iloc[:, :-1].values instead?

Bug fixes Â¶ Allow passing pandas data frames to all fit and predict methods (#148). Allow sparse matrices to be passed to sksurv.ensemble.GradientBoostingSurvivalAnalysis.predict() . Fix example in user guide using GridSearchCV to determine alphas for CoxnetSurvivalAnalysis (#186). Enhancements Â¶ Add score method to sksurv.meta.Stacking , sksurv.meta.EnsembleSelection , and sksurv.meta.EnsembleSelectionRegressor (#151). Add support for predict_cumulative_hazard_function and predict_survival_function to sksurv.ensemble.GradientBoostingSurvivalAnalysis .\\nand sksurv.ensemble.ComponentwiseGradientBoostingSurvivalAnalysis if model was fit with loss='coxph' . Add support for time-dependent predictions to sksurv.metrics.cumulative_dynamic_auc() See the User Guide for an example (#134). Backwards incompatible changes Â¶ The score method of sksurv.linear_model.IPCRidge , sksurv.svm.FastSurvivalSVM , and sksurv.svm.FastKernelSurvivalSVM (if rank_ratio is smaller than 1) now converts predictions on log(time) scale\\nto risk scores prior to computing the concordance index. Support for cvxpy and cvxopt solver in sksurv.svm.MinlipSurvivalAnalysis and sksurv.svm.HingeLossSurvivalSVM has been dropped. The default solver\\nis now ECOS, which was used by cvxpy (the previous default) internally. Therefore,\\nresults should be identical. Dropped the presort argument from sksurv.tree.SurvivalTree and sksurv.ensemble.GradientBoostingSurvivalAnalysis . The X_idx_sorted argument in sksurv.tree.SurvivalTree.fit() has been deprecated in scikit-learn 0.24 and has no effect now. predict_cumulative_hazard_function and predict_survival_function of sksurv.ensemble.RandomSurvivalForest and sksurv.tree.SurvivalTree now return an array of sksurv.functions.StepFunction objects by default.\\nUse return_array=True to get the old behavior.

We now require: Package Minimum Version Pandas 0.25.0 scikit-learn 0.24.0 scikit-survival 0.14.0 (2020-10-07) Â¶ This release features a complete overhaul of the documentation .\\nIt features a new visual design, and the inclusion of several interactive notebooks\\nin the User Guide . In addition, it includes important bug fixes.\\nIt fixes several bugs in sksurv.linear_model.CoxnetSurvivalAnalysis where predict , predict_survival_function , and predict_cumulative_hazard_function returned wrong values if features of the training data were not centered.\\nMoreover, the score function of sksurv.ensemble.ComponentwiseGradientBoostingSurvivalAnalysis and sksurv.ensemble.GradientBoostingSurvivalAnalysis will now\\ncorrectly compute the concordance index if loss='ipcwls' or loss='squared' . Bug fixes Â¶ sksurv.column.standardize() modified data in-place. Data is now always copied. sksurv.column.standardize() works with integer numpy arrays now. sksurv.column.standardize() used biased standard deviation for numpy arrays ( ddof=0 ),\\nbut unbiased standard deviation for pandas objects ( ddof=1 ). It always uses ddof=1 now.\\nTherefore, the output, if the input is a numpy array, will differ from that of previous versions.

Version 1.3 ï Tag: v1.3 Deployed Tuesday, February 9, 2021 Current Contributors: Benjamin Bengfort, Rebecca Bilbro, Paul Johnson, Philippe Billet, Prema Roman, Patrick Deziel This version primarily repairs the dependency issues we faced with scipy 1.6, scikit-learn 0.24 and Python 3.6 (or earlier). As part of the rapidly changing Python library landscape, weâve been forced to react quickly to dependency changes, even where those libraries have been responsibly issuing future and deprecation warnings. Major Changes: Implement new set_params and get_params on ModelVisualizers to ensure wrapped estimator is being correctly accessed via the new Estimator methods. Freeze the test dependencies to prevent variability in CI (must periodically review dependencies to ensure weâre testing what our users are experiencing). Change model param to estimator param to ensure that Visualizer arguments match their property names so that inspect works with get and set params and other scikit-learn utility functions.

Hotfix 1.2.1 ï Tag: v1.2.1 Deployed Friday, January 15, 2020 Contributors: Rebecca Bilbro, Benjamin Bengfort, Paul Johnson, Matt Harrison On December 22, 2020, scikit-learn released version 0.24 which deprecated the external use of scikit-learnâs internal utilities such as safe_indexing . Unfortunately, Yellowbrick depends on a few of these utilities and must refactor our internal code base to port this functionality or work around it. To ensure that Yellowbrick continues to work when installed via pip , we have temporarily changed our scikit-learn dependency to be less than 0.24. We will update our dependencies on the v1.3 release when we have made the associated fixes. Version 1.2 ï Tag: v1.2 Deployed Friday, October 9, 2020 Current Contributors: Rebecca Bilbro, Larry Gray, Vladislav Skripniuk, David Landsman, Prema Roman, @aldermartinez, Tan Tran, Benjamin Bengfort, Kellen Donohue, Kristen McIntyre, Tony Ojeda, Edwin Schmierer, Adam Morris, Nathan Danielsen Major Changes: Added Q-Q plot as side-by-side option to the ResidualsPlot visualizer. More robust handling of binary classification in ROCAUC visualization, standardizing the way that classifiers with predict_proba and decision_function methods are handling. A binary hyperparameter was added to the visualizer to ensure correct interpretation of binary ROCAUC plots.

Usually this means that your model is over fitting. See my answer below for more details, or try setting cv to a smaller number. – mgoldwasser Commented Mar 21, 2017 at 20:50 Add a comment | 5 Answers 5 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Trending (recent votes count more) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) 42 There is no reason r^2 shouldn't be negative (despite the ^2 in its name). This is also stated in the doc . You can see r^2 as the comparison of your model fit (in the context of linear regression, e.g a model of order 1 (affine)) to a model of order 0 (just fitting a constant), both by minimizing a squared loss. The constant minimizing the squared error is the mean. Since you are doing cross validation with left out data, it can happen that the mean of your test set is wildly different from the mean of your training set. This alone can induce a much higher incurred squared error in your prediction versus just predicting the mean of the test data, which results in a negative r^2 score. In worst case, if your data do not explain your target at all, these scores can become very strongly negative. Try import numpy as np\\nrng = np.random.RandomState(42)\\nX = rng.randn(100, 80)\\ny = rng.randn(100)  # y has nothing to do with X whatsoever\\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\\nfrom sklearn.cross_validation import cross_val_score\\nscores = cross_val_score(LinearRegression(), X, y, cv=5, scoring='r2') This should result in negative r^2 values. In [23]: scores\\nOut[23]: \\narray([-240.17927358,   -5.51819556,  -14.06815196,  -67.87003867,\\n    -64.14367035]) The important question now is whether this is due to the fact that linear models just do not find anything in your data, or to something else that may be fixed in the preprocessing of your data. Have you tried scaling your columns to have mean 0 and variance 1? You can do this using sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler . As a matter of fact, you should create a new estimator by concatenating a StandardScaler and the LinearRegression into a pipeline using sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline .\\nNext you may want to try Ridge regression.

I know that R^2 can be negative, but I thought it was supposed to be bounded to the interval [-1, 1]. Is that not the case? – rhombidodecahedron Commented Apr 12, 2014 at 23:41 6 R^2 is bounded above by 1.0, but it is not bounded below. Correlation is always bounded between -1 and 1. – eickenberg Commented Apr 13, 2014 at 18:10 Just because R^2 can be negative it does not mean that we should expect it to be. Please see my answer below for reasons why R^2 can be negative and how to fix them. – mgoldwasser Commented Mar 21, 2017 at 20:47 Add a comment | 22 Just because R^2 can be negative does not mean it should be. Possibility 1: a bug in your code. A common bug that you should double check is that you are passing in parameters correctly: r2_score(y_true, y_pred) # Correct!\\nr2_score(y_pred, y_true) # Incorrect!!!! Possibility 2: small datasets If you are getting a negative R^2, you could also check for over fitting. Keep in mind that cross_validation.cross_val_score() does not randomly shuffle your inputs, so if your sample are inadvertently sorted (by date for example) then you might build models on each fold that are not predictive for the other folds. Try reducing the number of features, increasing the number samples, and decreasing the number of folds (if you are using cross_validation ). While there is no official rule here, your m x n dataset (where m is the number of samples and n is the number of features) should be of a shape where m > n^2 and when you using cross validation with f as the number of folds, you should aim for m/f > n^2 Share Improve this answer Follow edited Sep 5, 2017 at 15:05 answered Mar 21, 2017 at 20:43 mgoldwasser mgoldwasser 15.5k \"\n}\n"

This was addressed in **Issue #9830**.  2. **SGD-based Predictors (e.g., `SGDClassifier`, `SGDRegressor`, `PassiveAggressiveClassifier`, `Perceptron`):**     - A bug was resolved where the `n_iter` parameter was not properly deprecated, causing issues when users tried to use it as an interim parameter. This affected models like `SGDClassifier` and others in the `linear_model` module (Issue #9558).  These fixes directly impact the reliability and usability of these predictor classes in Scikit-Learn."

Calculate the total distance traveled.\n2. Determine the number of water bottles consumed.\n3. Check if there is a recycling program that refunds money for the bottles, and if so, how much per bottle.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the total distance traveled\n\n- From Los Angeles to Cincinnati via I-40: The distance is approximately 1,200 miles.\n- From Cincinnati to Augusta via I-90: The distance is approximately 550 miles.\n\nTotal distance = 1,200 miles + 550 miles = 1,750 miles.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the number of water bottles consumed\n\n- You drink 5 12-ounce water bottles for every 100 miles.\n- For 1,750 miles, the number of water bottles consumed is \\( \\frac{1,750}{100} \\times 5 = 17.5 \\).

Let's check the refund rates for California, Ohio, and Maine.\n\n- California: The refund rate for a 12-ounce bottle is typically 5 cents per bottle.\n- Ohio: The refund rate for a 12-ounce bottle is typically 10 cents per bottle.\n- Maine: The refund rate for a 12-ounce bottle is typically 10 cents per bottle.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total refund based on these rates.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the total refund\n\n- For 20 bottles:\n  - California: \\( 20 \\times 0.05 = 1 \\) dollar.\n  - Ohio: \\( 20 \\times 0.10 = 2 \\) dollars.\n  - Maine: \\( 20 \\times 0.10 = 2 \\) dollars.\n\nSince the question does not specify which state's refund rate to use, we will assume the highest rate, which is 10 cents per bottle (Ohio and Maine).\n\nTherefore, the total refund is \\( 20 \\times 0.10 = 2 \\) dollars.\n\n\\boxed{2}",

It was produced by Where's Lunch and Worldwide Pants Incorporated , in association with HBO Independent Productions . The cast members were Ray Romano , Patricia Heaton , Brad Garrett , Doris Roberts , Peter Boyle , Madylin Sweeten , and Monica Horan . Most episodes of the nine-season series were filmed in front of a live studio audience . The series received positive reviews, won 15 Emmys out of 69 nominations and has been credited for helping revive the fortunes of CBS after struggling throughout the late 80s and early 90s. It was ranked the 49th all-time funniest television comedy by Complex , [ 1 ] the 60th best all-time series by TV Guide , [ 2 ] the eleventh-best sitcom starring a stand-up comedian and the 35th best sitcom of all time by Rolling Stone , [ 3 ] [ 4 ] and (alongside South Park ) the 63rd best written television series by the Writers Guild of America . [ 5 ] In a Hollywood Reporter poll of all-time television programs surveying 779 actors, 365 producers and 268 directors, Everybody Loves Raymond ranked 96th. [ 6 ] Series overview [ edit ] The show is centered on the day-to-day life of an Italian-American named Raymond \\\"Ray\\\" Barone, a sportswriter for Newsday living with his family on Long Island . Beleaguered and diffident yet dryly sarcastic, Ray takes few things seriously, making jokes in most situations, no matter how serious. He avoids responsibilities around the house and with his kids, leaving them to his wife, Debra, resulting in her being angry and stressed out quite often. Ray and Debra have a daughter Ally (Alexandra) and twin sons Michael and Geoffrey; the Barone children are regular characters but not a major focus. Raymond's parents, Marie and Frank, live across the street with their older son Robert (who later has his own apartment). The Barone relatives frequently make their presence known to Ray and Debra, much to the annoyance of the latter two. Although she loves them, Debra's justifiable complaints about Ray's overbearing family serve as one of the show's comedic elements. Out of the three unwanted visitors, Debra is particularly resentful of Marie, an insulting, controlling, manipulative woman who criticizes her passive-aggressively and praises Ray, clearly favoring him over other son Robert. Ray typically falls in the middle of family arguments, incapable of taking any decisive stand, especially if it might invoke Marie's disapproval. Robert, jealous of his younger sibling's position as their mother's favorite son and the success his brother has achieved professionally and personally, is Ray's biggest rival; Robert and Ray frequently argue like overgrown children, focusing much of their energy picking on or one-upping each other, although deep down they love each other dearly. Frank Barone is a retiree prone to directing insults and merciless put-downs at everyone he meets. Largely an absentee father when Ray and Robert were growing up, Frank buries his feelings and rarely yields to sentiment. As the series progresses, however, several episodes demonstrate that he loves his family immensely. Unlike everyone else, Frank has no problem criticizing Marie and often comes to Debra's defense, whenever Marie comments disparagingly about their daughter-in-law. Ray and Debra's marriage is fraught with conflicts. Ray prefers sports television over discussions with Debra on marital matters. Ray works full-time, as his father had, leaving most child-rearing responsibilities to his wife, and he is often forced against his will to help around the house. One of the show's recurring elements finds the couple having a long discussion in bed, before going to sleep.

Entertainment website Deadline Hollywood has reported that Phil Rosenthal, creator of the popular CBS series Everybody Loves Raymond , has signed a deal to create two new versions of that sitcom, one for Poland and one for Israel. The Emmy-winning series, which ran from September 1996 to May 2005, already has a successful Russian version called The Voronins , which almost rhymes with Barone, the last name of comic Ray Romano’s Long Island sportswriter character in the series, as well as his parents and older brother, Robert. Rosenthal, who created the original series along with Romano, has made a documentary called Exporting Raymond , which details how he franchised the comedy to Russia, where the show is the number one comedy on television.

Starring Ray Romano , the American sitcom followed Ray's family on Long Island, with his parents living right across the street from them. While Romano isn't the creator of the show, he has one condition if he were to agree to see a reboot. In an interview with Yahoo! Entertainment , Romano reveals that he will only watch a reboot... if it's not made in America. According to the actor, he hesitated about the idea of a revival due to how personal the show was to him. However, after learning that the show was adapted in other countries, he is open to the idea of the reboot being made overseas as he likes the idea of interpreting the show using other cultures. \\\"I'm just a little protective of Everybody Loves Raymond just because it was very personal to me. I mean, it was based on my life and I was such a part of the creative side of it and all.... I actually like that it's rebooted there because it just shows how other cultures — we're all the same. So it's good to see them appreciate it.\\\" There have been a few international reboots for Everybody Loves Raymond that were released in the past. The first was made in Russian and was released in 2009. Following that was a Polish version titled Everybody Loves Roman, An Egyptian version titled El Bab Fil Bab , and a Dutch remake called Everybody is Crazy about Jack , which all aired in 2011 .

He often avoids responsibilities around the house and with his kids, leaving this to wife Debra. Raymond and Debra have a daughter Ally (Alexandra) and twin sons Michael and Geoffrey (originally Matthew and Gregory in the pilot). The Barone children are regular characters but not a major focus. Raymond's parents, Marie and Frank, live across the street with older son Robert (who, later in the series, has his own apartment ). All Barone relatives frequently make their presence known to the annoyance of Raymond and Debra; Debra's justifiable complaints about Raymond's overbearing family serve as one of the show's comedic elements. Out of the three unwanted visitors, Debra is particularly intimidated by Marie, an insulting , controlling, manipulative (though ultimately caring) woman who criticizes Debra passive-aggressively and praises Ray, clearly favoring him over other son \\\"Robbie,\\\" whose birth necessitated her marriage (a fact revealed in the episode \\\"Good Girls\\\"). Raymond typically falls in the middle of family arguments, incapable of taking any decisive stand, especially if it might invoke his mother's disapproval. Robert, a miserable gentle giant, jealous of his younger sibling's position as favorite son and also of the success his brother has achieved both professionally and personally, is Ray's biggest rival. Robert and Raymond frequently argue like overgrown children, focusing much of their energy on picking on or one upping each other, although deep down they love each other dearly. Barone patriarch Frank is a fiery proletarian prone to insults and merciless put downs directed at any and all targets. Largely an absentee father when the boys were growing up, Frank buries his feelings and rarely gives in to sentiment. As the series progresses, however, several episodes demonstrate that the senior Barone loves his family immensely. Unlike everyone else, Frank has no problem comically criticizing Marie and often comes to Debra's defense following Marie's comments. Raymond and Debra's marriage is fraught with conflicts. Raymond prefers sports television over discussions with Debra on marital matters. Like his father, Raymond works full-time, leaving most child-rearing responsibilities to his wife; he often has to be forced into helping around the house. One of the show's recurring elements finds the couple having a long discussion in bed each night before going to sleep.

[ 2 ] Inhabiting the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans , they are notable for their exceptional longevity , although they are poorly studied due to the depth and remoteness of their natural habitat. [ 3 ] Greenland sharks have the longest lifespan of any known vertebrate , estimated to be between 250 and 500 years. [ 4 ] They are among the largest extant shark species, reaching a maximum confirmed length of 6.4 m (21 ft) long and weighing over 1,000 kg (2,200 lb). They reach sexual maturity at about 150 years of age, and their pups are born alive after an estimated gestation period of 8 to 18 years. [ 5 ] The shark is a generalist feeder, consuming a variety of available foods, including carrion . [ 6 ] Greenland shark meat is toxic to mammals due to its high levels of trimethylamine N -oxide , [ 7 ] although a treated form of it is eaten in Iceland as a delicacy known as kæstur hákarl . [ 8 ] Because they live deep in remote parts of the northern oceans, Greenland sharks are not considered a threat to humans. A possible attack occurred in August 1936 on two British fishermen, but the species was never identified. [ 9 ] Description [ edit ] The Greenland shark is one of the largest known existing species of shark, with adults growing to around 4 to 5 m. [ 10 ] The largest confirmed specimen measured up to 6.4 metres (21 ft) long and weighed around 1,023 kilograms (2,255 lb). [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] The all-tackle International Game Fish Association (IGFA) record for this species is 775 kg (1,709 lb). [ 14 ] It rivals the Pacific sleeper shark (possibly up to 7 m or 23 ft long) for the largest species in the family Somniosidae . Genetic data indicate that Greenland sharks diverged from ancestral sleeper sharks in the Canadian Arctic approximately 1–2.34 million years ago during the Pleistocene epoch , likely influenced by glacial fluctuations that periodically isolated marine populations. These ecological challenges may have driven physiological and metabolic adaptations for cold, deep waters. [ 15 ] The Greenland shark is a thickset species, with a short, rounded snout, small eyes, and small dorsal and pectoral fins. [ 11 ] The gill openings are very small for the species' great size. Female Greenland sharks are typically larger than males, with males reaching maturity at a smaller size than females. [ 16 ] Greenland shark at Admiralty Inlet , Nunavut , with visible Ommatokoita Coloration can range from pale creamy-gray to blackish-brown and the body is typically uniform in color, though whitish spots or faint dark streaks are occasionally seen on the back. [ 13 ] The shark is often infested by the copepod Ommatokoita elongata , a crustacean which attaches itself to the shark's eyes. [ 17 ] It was speculated that the copepod may display bioluminescence and thus attract prey for the shark in a mutualistic relationship, but this hypothesis has not been verified.

Greenland shark — Greenland sharks, which live an average of at least 272 years, rank as the longest-lived vertebrates on Earth, a new study indicates; they may live beyond 400 years. The joys of a long life are surely countless, but there's one small hitch: These sharks do not achieve sexual maturity until 150 or so. These natives of the North Atlantic Ocean can grow to be 21 feet long and 2,000 pounds. Blind due to the many parasites crowding their eyes, these sharks are said to have an impeccable sense of smell, which they make ample use of when they hunt. Franco Banfi/WaterFrame RM/Getty Images Tuatara — Tuatara, which live on 32 offshore islands of New Zealand, are the only surviving species in an ancient order of reptiles that lived during the age of dinosaurs. They tip the scales at 2 pounds or less, according to Encyclopedia Britannica . They can live more than 100 years, with most arriving safely at 60 -- an age that does not stop some females from continuing to reproduce. The tuatara's bite is strong, with a single row of teeth in its lower jaw fitting into a groove between two rows of chompers in its upper jaw. Though this reptile has no ears, it can hear, and though it has three eyes, only two can see. Shutterstock Immortal jellyfish — The turritopsis nutricula (dohrnii) species of jellyfish lives a normal life, but when a crisis arises, it can transform itself into a younger state. This process, known as \\\"transdifferentiation,\\\" renders the jellyfish into a bloblike cyst, according to a 2003 study. Eventually, the blob becomes a colony of polyps, and from there, \\\"it\\\" can spawn hundreds of genetically identical copies of itself. Hence, this pinky-nail-size being is commonly referred to as the \\\"immortal jellyfish.\\\" The Asahi Shimbun/Getty Images Bowhead whale — Scientists estimate the lifespan of this whale species, which commonly roams the Arctic, to be more than 100 years. This calculation is based on analyses of eye tissue plus the recovery of stone harpoon tips in their blubber, the World Wildlife Fund said. Spanning 60 feet and weighing thousands of pounds, these whales can break through 7 inches of sea ice to reach air. Black skin is accented by a single white beauty mark on the lower snout, and the females are larger than the males. After feeding, the bowhead whale comes to the surface of the water to rest. Paul Nicklen/National Geographic Creative/Getty Images Giant tortoise — The old Spanish word \\\"galapago\\\" means \\\"saddle,\\\" which describes the shape of a giant tortoise's shell -- and became the term used by ancient explorers. This, then, is the origin of the name for the Galapagos Islands, where it is estimated upward of 20,000 wild tortoises live today, according to the Galapagos Conservancy . These turtles are big, averaging 475 pounds packed into just 4 feet. Uniquely, they have developed the ability to survive without food or water for up to a year, and as a result, they commonly live 100 years.

The shark is typically found in the Arctic and at depths of up to 7,000 feet below the ocean surface. Devanshi Kasana hide caption toggle caption Devanshi Kasana Researchers caught a Greenland shark off the coast of Belize in April, the first reported sighting of the species in the western Caribbean. The shark is typically found in the Arctic and at depths of up to 7,000 feet below the ocean surface. Devanshi Kasana Researchers tagging tiger sharks off the southern coast of Belize couldn't believe their eyes when they recently reeled in a different kind of fish. It turned out to be a Greenland shark, which is typically found in the Arctic and can live to be over 500 years old. The team of scientists thought the shark was dead when they finally hauled it to the surface. Unlike the tiger sharks they were after, this particular shark had black, worn-looking skin and pale blue eyes. Devanshi Kasana, a Ph.D. candidate at the Florida International University Predator Ecology and Conservation lab, said the shark looked \\\"really, really old.\\\" Sponsor Message \\\"It was just very surprising and confusing,\\\" she said. \\\"As soon as it entered our field of vision, we saw a black figure that was getting bigger and bigger. When it came to the surface, none of the crew with all of their combined fishing experience had seen anything like that.\\\" Kasana and colleagues published an article on the capture in the journal Marine Biology in July. Kasana said the discovery is especially exciting because it suggests that these sharks, which were thought to mainly exist in the Arctic, can be found in the tropics as well. Greenland sharks can likely live to be more than 500 years old Scientists have more questions than answers when it comes the Greenland shark. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, these sharks are the longest-living vertebrates on the planet, living possibly more than 500 years. And that's just an estimate, because there's no definite way of determining their age. The reason they live to be so old may have something to do with their speed of life, which is slow — very, very slow. Greenland sharks grow approximately one-third of an inch per year and can grow to more than 20 feet in length. And researchers believe the sharks don't reach sexual maturity until sometime after the first 100 years of their life. Sponsor Message According to Kasana, some scientists have theorized that the Greenland shark can be found across the globe, if one knows where to look. They love cold water, which is why they're found in the Arctic. However, they've also been discovered as far south as off the coast of Georgia, thousands of feet beneath the ocean surface. The theory is that the closer the sharks are to the equator, the deeper researchers have to go to find them. And they go deep, over 7,000 feet down, according to NOAA. The catch was unexpected Kasana said their catch was strictly accidental. On April 22, she and her team were working with members of the Belizean shark fishing community and the Belize Fisheries Department to set lines along Glovers Reef, located about 30 miles off the coast. The waters of the reef can be as shallow as 25 feet, but steep drop-offs can reach more than 2,000 feet down. \\\"It slopes suddenly and the depth goes really deep really fast,\\\" Kasana said. \\\"We believe the line dragged from a much shallower depth to the drop-off, which is why we ended up catching this individual.\\\" A report of the encounter published on July 15 claims this was the first Greenland shark to be discovered in the Western Caribbean. Knowing how rare the experience was, Kasana said her team discussed buying a lottery ticket s\"\n}\n**Web Page 4:**\n{\n  \"id\": 4,\n  \"title\": \"9 Facts about the Greenland Shark - Oceanwide Expeditions\",\n  \"url\": \"https://oceanwide-expeditions.com/blog/8-facts-about-the-greenland-shark\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Greenland sharks are Earth's longest-living vertebrates.

Nonetheless, Greenland shark meat can be prepared in a fermentation process that removes the TMAO, resulting in a much-enjoyed national dish of Iceland. This dish, known as Hákarl or kæstur hákarl, is prepared by hanging the meat of the Greenland shark up for four to five months, thus removing the adverse effects of the neurotoxins. 3. Greenland sharks do not attack humans There are some early Inuit legends that claim Greenland sharks have attacked numerous kayaks, but the reality is that there is not one documented case of such an encounter. Greenland sharks are large and strong enough to easily injure or kill a human if they feel threatened, but history has shown them to be especially non-confrontational. 4. Swimming unseen is a Greenland shark talent It is understandable that people who take Greenland cruises may want to see Greenland sharks, but in fact the odds are rather low. This species was not even captured on film for the first time until 1995, and it took 18 more years for anyone to get a video that depicted Greenland sharks in their natural environment. By NOAA Photo Library (expl9984) [ CC BY 2.0 or Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons 5. Greenland sharks are master divers One of the primary reasons Greenland sharks are spotted so infrequently is their ability to dive to such extreme depths. Researchers have recorded them going as deep as 2,200 meters (7,218 feet), and they can sometimes be found relaxing on the slopes and shelves far under the ocean’s surface. 6. No food is too good for a Greenland shark Vultures have earned a reputation for being nature’s garbage disposals, and the same can be said of Greenland sharks. Although these fish can be found eating seals and fish, Greenland sharks are believed to be primarily scavengers, nourishing themselves on any flesh they can find. Whether living or dead, no dish is turned down by a Greenland shark. 7. Greenland sharks know that slow and steady wins the race Perhaps because they will eat almost anything, Greenland sharks never seem to be in a hurry. Their average pace of 0.3 meters per second (0.76 mph) is so slow that they are also known as “sleeper sharks,” and they can only increase their speed for short bursts. Even so, the size of a Greenland shark helps protect it from any would-be predators. 8. The colder the water, the happier the Greenland shark All sharks are cold-blooded, but this particular species truly thrives in a frigid environment. Greenland sharks prefer to stay in water ranging from -1 to 10°C (30.2 to 50°F), and they migrate to the coldest part of the water each season. Indeed, Greenland sharks are the only known shark species that can tolerate Arctic conditions all year long. 9. Greenland sharks are Earth’s longest-living vertebrates Analyzing the eyes of Greenland sharks, scientists have discovered the possibility that these fish can live to 400 years old or more. The transparent tissue in the Greenland shark eye lens is metabolically inactive, with new layers added throughout the shark’s lifetime, much like the rings of a tree. The scientists examined the lens tissue of 28 female Greenland sharks captured in the north Atlantic, using radiocarbon dating to measure the amounts of a particular carbon isotope absorbed by the innermost part of the lens. Age estimates of the two biggest sharks placed them at around 335 to 392 years old. The analysis of all the shark tissue indicated that the lifespan of a Greenland shark ranges between 252 and 512 years, with 390 the likeliest average. Even if Greenland sharks typically lived only to the lower range of that estimate, they would be the longest-living vertebrate known to science.

Vulnerable LC NT VU EN CR EW EX Least Concern Extinct The Greenland shark is the world’s longest living vertebrate . It can live for 400 years— twice the age of the longest-living land animal , the giant tortoise. There could be an individual in the ocean today that was alive during the 1665 Great Plague of London and George Washington ’s presidential inauguration in 1789. Despite its name, the Greenland shark is not only found in Greenland ; it has been spotted as far away as the western Caribbean . Also known as the gray, ground, gurry, or sleeper shark, this animal lives in incredibly cold, deep waters, so it is much less studied than many of the more than 500 other shark species . It is one of the slowest sharks , too: Its scientific name, Somniosus microcephalus, roughly translates to “ sleepy small-head .” Yet these rare animals may be a top predator. The world’s longest-living vertebrate Many shark species can be aged by counting growth bands on their vertebrae , like rings on a tree . The Greenland shark’s soft vertebrae do not have these bands , however. Instead, its age is determined by removing the layers of the lens of its eye—which continues growing throughout its lifetime—and radiocarbon dating the tissue in the center. Using this method, scientists discovered Greenland sharks have a life expectancy of at least 272 years and could reach 392, give or take about 120 years. What’s more, these slow-growing creatures don’t reach reproductive age until around 150 years old . Measuring the Greenland shark’s growth rate is challenging because individuals are rarely recaptured. However, one shark tagged in 1936 had only grown 2.3 inches when it reappeared 16 years later . Life in the cold The largest fish in the Arctic Ocean —and the only shark found there year-round—the Greenland shark also inhabits the North Atlantic and Russian high Arctic. Infrequently observed at the surface, it can live in waters 7,200 feet deep and between 28.4 to 44.6 Fahrenheit ( minus 2 to 7 degrees Celsius ). Specially adapted for cold water, this shark’s tissues contain high levels of chemical compounds that act like anti-freeze and prevent ice crystals forming in the body . These sharks conserve energy by swimming very slowly—about 1.12 feet per second —but can exhibit short bursts of speed to ambush prey. Appearance, diet, and behavior Dark gray, brown, or black with a cylinder-shaped body, small eyes, rounded snout, and no anal fin , Greenland sharks resemble a submarine and can reach 23 feet long and may weigh 1.5 tons . In comparison, the great white shark grows to 15 to 20 feet but is significantly heavier, weighing 2.5 tons or more. Greenland sharks have narrow, pointed upper teeth and broader, squared teeth on the lower jaw. Holding large prey in position with their upper teeth, they roll their head in a circular motion, using the lower teeth like a blade to tear off circular chunks of flesh . Smaller prey is eaten whole. Primarily scavengers , Greenland sharks are not fussy eaters and consume a variety of fish, squid, and carrion . Stomach contents of  sharks have even included polar bears, horses, and reindeer .

The research, published in Science magazine, found the Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate – or animal with a backbone-- in the world. The gray-colored sharks live in the cold waters of the Arctic and are named after Greenland, the world’s largest island. After examining one of these sharks, scientists decided it was born in the icy waters about 400 years ago, and only died recently. A Greenland Shark. Credit: Julius Nielsen An international team of biologists and physicists was able to estimate the ages of 28 dead female Greenland sharks by studying the lenses of their eyes. It is a new way to learn the age of an animal. Eight of the sharks were probably 200 years old or more, and could even have been 300 years old. That would make them older than the bowhead whale, which earlier was believed to have been the oldest vertebrate at about 211 years old, according to the Associated Press. This also means Greenland sharks can live more than three times longer than humans. Many people these days can expect to live into their eighties. African elephants average about 70 years. The oldest of the Greenland sharks the scientists studied was nearly 5 meters long. It was thought to have been 392 years old when it was caught four years ago. But because the testing method is so new, it is not exact. The study’s lead author is Julius Nielsen, a marine biologist from Denmark. He says the 392 number could be off by as much as 120 years in either direction. That means the shark was probably born sometime between the years 1500 and 1740, with 1620 being the most likely. \\\"It's an estimate. It's not a determination ,\\\" Nielsen said. \\\"It is the best we can do.\\\" Even at the lowest age, the shark would have been 272 years old when it died, and still would be the longest-living animal with a backbone, Nielsen said. \\\"I don't know why they get as old, but I hope someone will find out,\\\" Nielsen said. Christopher Lowe is director of the shark lab at California State University in Long Beach. He was not part of the study, but praised it. In an email to AP, Lowe wrote that he is not surprised that Greenland sharks live a long time. But, he said, \\\"I'm really shocked by the magnitude of that longevity .\\\" Lowe said that when the water is deep and cold, that usually means fish can live a long time. Why? It could be because the cold water slows down an animal’s metabolism—or the way it processes food into energy. A Greenland shark swimming. Credit: Julius Nielsen While Greenland sharks are among the largest fish in the world, they only grow about one centimeter a year. That fact caught Nielson’s attention and he decided to find a way to determine their age. To get the age estimates, Nielsen and his team used a complex system that combines chemical tests, mathematical models and growth measurements. The research also suggested the female Greenland sharks do not mate and have babies until they are about 150 years old. That may not be good news, because the Greenland sharks may not have many young. If too many are caught, the species could die out. The scientists worry that the sharks are being caught up and killed with other species by commercial fisheries. Some animals without backbones can live even longer.

Thanks to a new study from researchers at the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources and the Natural History Museum of Denmark and colleagues, though, we now know one more thing about this gentle arctic giant: the fact that it’s a big stinkin’ liar . The rest of this article is behind a paywall. Please sign in or subscribe to access the full content. Okay, to be fair, it’s more “whoever named the species”, rather than the sharks themselves – and it was presumably not on purpose. But after careful and painstaking analysis of various Danish, Norwegian, and German museum specimens and international catch and observation databases, the verdict is in: Greenland sharks are probably born closer to Denmark than their national namesake. “The study breathes new life into the story of the Greenland shark throughout the North Atlantic,” said Peter Rask Møller, an associate professor and marine biologist at the Natural History Museum of Denmark and coauthor of the new paper, in a statement last week. “And, among other things, [it] provides an understanding of how Denmark's deepest sea area also plays a role in the species' life history.” Searching for giants Greenland sharks ( Somniosus microcephalus ) may live for upwards of 500 years , but where they begin that epic lifespan so far been a complete mystery. Pupping grounds, where mother sharks deliver and their babies start their lives, are unknown, despite the pups being reasonably sized – not too far off the length of a human newborn, actually – and potentially numbering in the hundreds per litter. That wouldn’t be a problem, of course, except that – like sharks in general around the world – Greenland sharks are struggling right now: they’re currently listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, thanks mostly to overfishing and “bycatch”. “The number one threat to sharks and their relatives, by far – so much that there is really not a number two threat – is unsustainable overfishing,” David Shiffman , shark conservation scientist and author of Why Sharks Matter , told IFLScience earlier this year. “Humans are killing more sharks than sharks are having babies.” “Overfishing is a big problem for lots of species, and the knock-on ecological effects of some harmful fishing practices are especially harmful for a lot of species and ecosystems,” explained Shiffman, who was not involved in the new study. “But sharks in particular are extremely biologically vulnerable to this, and that's because they have relat\"\n}\n**Web Page 9:**\n{\n  \"id\": 9,\n  \"title\": \"The Strange and Gruesome Story of the Greenland Shark, the ...\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-strange-and-gruesome-story-of-the-greenland-shark-the-longest-living-vertebrate-on-earth\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Still, it firmly established Greenland sharks as the longest-living vertebrates on Earth.

He and his\\nco-authors did note, however, that their lens technique might be useful\\nin the field of forensics. Not long after the study was published,\\nHeinemeier received a request from police in Germany. They needed his\\nhelp cracking an unusual case. In the city of Wenden, near Cologne, a\\nteen-ager had opened his family’s freezer in search of a snack and\\ndiscovered the bodies of three infant girls, wrapped in plastic. The\\ninvestigators suspected the boy’s mother of having killed the children,\\nbut she denied it. While the victims’ ages were obvious—all were clearly\\nnewborns—the police had no way of knowing when the murders had taken\\nplace. Heinemeir analyzed the infants’ lenses and came up with\\nremarkably precise estimates. Two, he found, had been born in the second\\nhalf of the nineteen-eighties, the third between 2003 and 2007. Although\\none of the murders fell outside Germany’s two-decade statute of\\nlimitations on manslaughter, the others were prosecutable. The mother\\nwas ultimately sentenced to four years in prison. In 2009, Heinemeier received another request, this time from Steffensen,\\nwho had recently travelled to Greenland and confronted the longevity\\npuzzle. Was there a way, Steffensen asked, to use the sharks’ soft\\nvertebrae for carbon dating? Heinemeier told him about his recent\\nbreakthrough in the murder case and suggested that Steffensen return to\\nGreenland and bring back some lenses. But there was a problem. Though\\nsharks do possess crystallines in their eyes, acquiring enough samples\\nfor a rigorous study was an expensive and logistically tricky\\nproposition; at first, Steffensen managed to get just two. Hearing this\\nat one of Steffensen’s lectures, Nielsen, a young biology student,\\nproposed a solution. He had spent the summer in Greenland, working on\\nresearch vessels for the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources, and\\nit occurred to him that the trawlers’ unwanted bycatch was a biological\\ngoldmine. Over the next five years, as Nielsen completed a master’s and\\nthen a doctorate at the University of Copenhagen, he and a group of\\nresearch trawlers and local fishermen harvested eyes from twenty-eight\\nGreenland sharks. Instagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Nielsen and his collaborators published their results in\\nAugust of last\\nyear. Using Heinemeier’s method, they found that the smallest of the\\nsharks they caught—those around seven feet long—were born after the bomb\\npulse, while the largest animals were born well before it. With the help\\nof a mathematical model that linked size with age, they estimated that\\none sixteen-foot female was at least two hundred and seventy-two years\\nold, and possibly as much as five hundred and twelve years old. Because\\nit is difficult to establish background carbon-14 levels in the ocean,\\nand because Nielsen and his colleagues didn’t know which part of the\\nocean the sharks had been born in, the figure was inexact. Still, it\\nfirmly established Greenland sharks as the longest-living vertebrates on\\nEarth. In theory, the biggest ones could be nearly six centuries old. The question now is how the sharks do it. Increasingly, scientists are\\nsearching the natural world for the genetic and behavioral mechanisms\\nthat endow creatures with their special abilities—that make elephants\\nvirtually immune to cancer, say, or axolotls capable of regenerating a\\nlost limb. There may be Greenland sharks alive today that were born\\nbefore Christopher Columbus; the species is not even thought to reach\\nsexual maturity until around a hundred and fifty years of age. Why? The\\nanswer likely has to do with a very slow metabolism and the cold waters\\nthat they inhabit. But for now, Nielsen said, it’s yet another mystery.\\n“I’m just the messenger on this,” he told me. “I have no idea.” M. R. O’Connor has contributed to The New Yorker since 2015.

PMC Copyright notice PMCID: PMC9459837  PMID: 36080935 Abstract Understanding the growth status of fruits can enable precise growth management and improve the product quality. Previous studies have rarely used deep learning to observe changes over time, and manual annotation is required to detect hidden regions of fruit. Thus, additional research is required for automatic annotation and tracking fruit changes over time. We propose a system to record the growth characteristics of individual apples in real time using Mask R-CNN. To accurately detect fruit regions hidden behind leaves and other fruits, we developed a region detection model by automatically generating 3000 composite orchard images using cropped images of leaves and fruits. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified on a total of 1417 orchard images obtained from the monitoring system, tracking the size of fruits in the images. The mean absolute percentage error between the true value manually annotated from the images and detection value provided by the proposed method was less than 0.079, suggesting that the proposed method could extract fruit sizes in real time with high accuracy. Moreover, each prediction could capture a relative growth curve that closely matched the actual curve after approximately 150 elapsed days, even if a target fruit was partially hidden. Keywords: deep learning, automatic generation data, growth prediction, individual identification 1. Introduction Precision agriculture involves detailed observation, control, and planning of farmland and crop conditions, and substantial research on precision agriculture has been conducted to improve productivity by using information and communication technology and the internet of things to understand the growth conditions of agricultural crops [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]. Kobayashi et al. [ 4 ] developed a high-resolution image comparison system to extract crop growth information by observing the changes in their appearance. In addition, Genno et al. [ 5 ] predicted the fruit radius from apple growth curves based on the green-blue vegetation index leaf area in apple orchards. In Genno et al.’s study [ 5 ], the entire fruit tree was evaluated based on a single growth curve, while growth curves for individual fruits were not obtained. More precise management would be possible if the growth of individual fruits could be predicted. Research on the recognition of individual fruits using deep learning to support yield mapping and harvesting robots is underway [ 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ]. In addition, various attempts have been made [ 12 ] on fruit detection for workload estimation. Gongal et al. [ 13 ] developed image processing for apple identification, which can avoid repetitive counting of apples using 3D information, and achieved an accuracy of 82% for crop load estimation. However, these studies estimated the fruit area at a specific time and did not observe changes for individual fruits over time. Understanding the growth status of a single fruit would enable precise growth management and improve the quality of the products. Tracked detection of individual fruits is necessary to capture changes over time. Wenli et al. [ 14 ] were able to track the detection of oranges from dynamic point images, but they only counted the number of oranges and did not provide a follow-up growth prediction. Marini et al. [ 15 ] developed a regression model to estimate fruit weight at the time of harvest using three years of data on initial fruit diameters; however, t\"\n}\n**Web Page 5:**\n{\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"title\": \"[PDF] Fruit classification and Recognition using Deep Learning\",\n  \"url\": \"https://cigrjournal.org/index.php/Ejounral/article/download/7847/4067/39527\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Deep CNN is used to detect the fruit images (Sa, I.,.

This paper presents the use of a state-of-the-art object detection framework, Faster R-CNN, in the context of fruit detection in orchards, including mangoes, almonds and apples. Ablation studies are presented to better understand the practical deployment of the detection network, including how much training data is required to capture variability in the dataset. Data augmentation techniques are shown to yield significant performance gains, resulting in a greater than two-fold reduction in the number of training images required. In contrast, transferring knowledge between orchards contributed to negligible performance gain over initialising the Deep Convolutional Neural Network directly from ImageNet features. Finally, to operate over orchard data containing between 100-1000 fruit per image, a tiling approach is introduced for the Faster R-CNN framework. The study has resulted in the best yet detection performance for these orchards relative to previous works, with an F1-score of >0.9 achieved for apples and mangoes.

In the words of the authors, this module tells the network “where to look.” For each proposed box, the region classification step then computes a probability distribution over the classes that the box can belong to. The variants of Faster R-CNN that exist differ in the set of convolutional layers that is used to extract image features for the region proposal part of the network. Whereas the VGG-16 variant with its 13 convolutional layers is deeper and more computationally intensive, the ZF variant is shallower but faster. Prior to the advent of deep neural networks, features in computer vision models were engineered manually for a specific task and the specific conditions under which the data has been collected. Deep learning models automatically learn these features, thus saving a considerable amount of development time. The publication the Sa et al. paper on the DeepFruits system[5] marks an important milestone in the development of deep learning approaches to fruit detection. DeepFruits builds upon Faster R-CNN to detect sweet peppers and rock melons in images taken in a greenhouse. The system can be trained in a matter of a few hours, runs on commodity hardware and performs detection in around 400 milliseconds per image. The authors use the VGG-16 variant of Faster R-CNN and show that filters in the first layer specialize in low-level features such as reddish and greenish colors corresponding to red and green sweet papers. Regions in higher-level layers with strong activation often correspond to image regions that belong to fruits. A region containing fruits is considered to be detected when the intersection over union score is greater than 0.4. Using this threshold, the authors report F1 scores between 0.8 and 0.84 for the task of sweet pepper detection. The best-performing approach combines proposals from separately trained models for RGB and near-infrared images using a scoring method termed “later fusion.” Interestingly, DeepFruit reaches a respectable F1 score of 0.8 when the Faster R-CNN component is fine-tuned on a mere 20 training images. It should be noted that the data sets used in the experiments were quite small. Each classifier was trained on around 100 images and tested on a few dozen images. Since its publication, a number of new papers have built upon DeepFruits to solve similar and more challenging problems. One notable example is a paper published by Bargoti & Underwood on fruit detection in orchards[1]. The researchers used a robotic vehicle during daylight hours to capture high-resolution whole tree images for three fruit types: apples, almonds and mangoes. In total, the data set contains more than 2,000 training images and almost 500 test images. The authors emphasize the increased difficulty due to the high pixel count per fruit and the low fruit-count per image. Almond trees, for example, can host 1,000–10,000 almonds and are of a smaller size than the other fruit varieties. Both DeepFruits and the system described in the Bargoti & Underwood paper use Faster R-CNN and treat fruit detection as a set of binary problems: one detector is trained for each fruit type. Another commonality is the application of non-maximum suppression (NMS), a procedure designed to handle overlapping regions. NMS eliminates regions associated with lower confidence that are strongly overlapping with high-confidence candidates, as measured by the Intersection over Union score. Bargoti & Underwood experimented with different data augmentation techniques and found that the largest boost in performance is achieved by flipping and scaling the available images. VGG-16 requires 2.5 GB of GPU memory for 0.25 megapixels image. To overcome this bottleneck, the authors employ an approach that they refer to as “Tiled Faster R-CNN”: detections are performed using a window of appropriate size that is sliding over the image. To ensure that fruits are not split across tiles, the overlap between two tiles is greater than the maximum fruit size. NMS is then applied over the combined output over all tiles. Using this setup, the VGG va\"\n}\n**Web Page 8:**\n{\n  \"id\": 8,\n  \"title\": \"Example images of the detection for two fruits.

Proximal imaging using tractor-mounted cameras is a simple and cost-effective method to acquire large quantities of data in orchards and vineyards. It can be used for the monitoring of vegetation and for the management of field operations such as the guidance of smart spraying systems for instance. One of the most prolific research subjects in arboriculture is fruit detection during the growing season. Estimations of fruit-load can be used for early yield assessments and for the monitoring of harvest and thinning. In addition, the visual aspects of fruits enable to appraise their growth and ripening status. This paper proposes a new approach for real-time fruit detection, combining a fast geometrical pre-processing whose output feeds a deep neural network (DNN) classifier. The first step is a radial Hough-like operator, which aims at identifying quickly the regions of interest, restricting the use of the DNNs to the most probably genuine candidates. The proposed method is generic enough to be applied on most near-spherical fruits. It was tested in two contexts: grapes and apples, with different varieties and phenological stages. In both cases the proposed method provided promising results. Correlation coefficients with manual counting and real harvest loads are up to 0.96 for grapes and up to 0.85 for apples. Keywords.

Monticello, IL: International Society of Precision Agriculture.Introduction Since the beginning of the 1980’s, automated detection and counting of fruits in vineyards and orchards has been a major concern and a very prolific research subject in computer vision. The implementation of computer vision algorithms enables applications such as the quality grading of fruits, yield mappings, robotized picking and disease detection (Gemtos et al., 2013). Jimenez et al. (2000) summarizes the most noticeable approaches for fruit detection assisted by computer vision. Some fruits, like oranges or tomatoes are easy to detect at maturity, since their color differs a lot from the foliage. In other cases, template matching algorithms, texture analysis or shape identification (e.g. circular Hough transform) have\"\n}\n"

        "turn_1_webpage_analyses": "The DeepFruits paper (\"DeepFruits: A Fruit Detection System Using Deep Neural Networks\" by Sa et al., 2016) is highlighted as a foundational work in the field of fruit detection using deep learning. Key features influencing its prominence (and likely the size of its bubble on the Connected Papers graph) include:1. **Methodology**:     - The paper pioneered the use of Faster R-CNN (a state-of-the-art object detection framework at the time) for fruit detection in agricultural settings (Web Page 7).     - It demonstrated effective fruit detection in challenging environments (e.g., greenhouse-grown sweet peppers and rock melons) using both RGB and near-infrared imagery (Web Pages 3, 7, and 8).  2. **Performance**:     - Achieved F1 scores of 0.8–0.84 with minimal training data (e.g., 20 training images for some configurations), showcasing robustness and efficiency (Web Page 7).     - The system operated in real-time (~400 ms per image) on commodity hardware, making it practical for field applications (Web Page 7).  3. **Influence**:     - The paper is cited as a milestone in the development of deep learning for robotic harvesting and yield mapping (Web Page 7).     - Subsequent studies (e.g., Bargoti & Underwood, 2017) built upon its methodology, indicating its foundational role in the field (Web Page 7).  4. **Citation Network**:     - The Connected Papers example graph references DeepFruits as a key node (Web Page 3), suggesting it serves as a central reference point in the academic network, which likely correlates with its bubble size.  These factors collectively explain why the paper might occupy a prominent position (large bubble) on the 2016 Connected Papers graph."

NASA/Reuters By TIME Photo December 11, 2015 2:36 PM EST This photo of Pluto was made during the New Horizons spacecraft's historic flyby of the dwarf planet in July 2015. New Horizons is now sailing into the Kuiper Belt for a rendezvous with another small world. NASA/Reuters This nebula named \\\"Thor's Helmet\\\" is powered by a central \\\"Wolf Rayet\\\" star whose explosive tantrums blow huge bubbles of gas and make them glow like neon. This star is easily 20 times the mass of the Sun and located 15,000 light years away. Eventually the star's instability will lead it to explode as a supernova.  The photo was captured at the Mount Lemmon SkyCenter in Arizona and released on Jan. 3, 2015. Adam Block—Mount Lemmon SkyCenter/University of Arizona Super Typhoon Maysak, as seen from aboard the International Space Station on March 31, 2015. NASA Astronaut Terry Virts captured this image and tweeted \\\"The eye of #Maysak typhoon really stands out early in the morning with the shadow being cast deep into the vortex.\\\" His ESA crewmate on station also viewed the storm and wrote, \\\"Commands respect even from #space...\\\" Terry Virts—NASA The total solar eclipse at Svalbard, Norway, on March 20, 2015. A partial solar eclipse was seen in Europe, northern and eastern Asia and northern and western Africa. Olav Jon Nesvold—EPA Pluto's haze layer shows its blue color in this picture taken by the New Horizons spacecraft on Oct. 8, 2015 after it passed the dwarf planet. The high-altitude haze is thought to be similar to that seen at Saturn’s moon Titan. The source of both hazes likely involves sunlight-initiated chemical reactions of nitrogen and methane, leading to relatively small, soot-like particles called tholins.

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.

The paper introduced a new deep learning architecture known as the transformer , based on the attention mechanism proposed in 2014 by Bahdanau et al. [ 4 ] It is considered a foundational [ 5 ] paper in modern artificial intelligence , and a main contributor to the AI boom , as the transformer approach has become the main architecture of a wide variety of AI, such as large language models . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] At the time, the focus of the research was on improving Seq2seq techniques for machine translation , but the authors go further in the paper, foreseeing the technique's potential for other tasks like question answering and what is now known as multimodal generative AI . [ 1 ] The paper's title is a reference to the song \\\" All You Need Is Love \\\" by the Beatles . [ 8 ] The name \\\"Transformer\\\" was picked because Jakob Uszkoreit, one of the paper's authors, liked the sound of that word. [ 9 ] An early design document was titled \\\"Transformers: Iterative Self-Attention and Processing for Various Tasks\\\", and included an illustration of six characters from the Transformers franchise. The team was named Team Transformer. [ 8 ] Some early examples that the team tried their Transformer architecture on included English-to-German translation, generating Wikipedia articles on \\\"The Transformer\\\", and parsing . These convinced the team that the Transformer is a general purpose language model, and not just good for translation. [ 9 ] As of 2025, [update] the paper has been cited more than 173,000 times, [ 10 ] placing it among top ten most-cited papers of the 21st century. [ 11 ] Authors [ edit ] The authors of the paper are: Ashish Vaswani , Noam Shazeer , Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones [ wikidata ] , Aidan Gomez , Łukasz Kaiser, and Illia Polosukhin. All eight authors were \\\"equal contributors\\\" to the paper; the listed order was randomized. The Wired article highlights the group's diversity: [ 8 ] Six of the eight authors were born outside the United States; the other two are children of two green-card-carrying Germans who were temporarily in California and a first-generation American whose family had fled persecution, respectively. After the paper, each of the authors left Google to join other companies or to found startups . Several of them expressed feelings of being unable to innovate and expand the Transformer in a direction they want, if they had stayed at Google. [ 12 ] Methods discussed and introduced [ edit ] The paper is most well known for the introduction of the Transformer architecture, which forms the underlying architecture for most forms of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) . A key reason for why the architecture is preferred by most modern LLMs is the parallelizability of the architecture over its predecessors. This ensures that the operations necessary for training can be accelerated on a GPU allowing both faster training times and models of bigger sizes to be trained. The following mechanisms were introduced by the paper as part of the development of the transformer architecture.

In this blog, I’ll walk you through the mathematical operations that drive a transformer, focusing on a clear, step-by-step breakdown of matrix computations. To keep it intuitive, I’ll use values in matrices, architectural and parametric details, keeping BERT as reference. The transformer model processes words in parallel and uses self-attention to find relationships I will be using the above sentence as input to the transformer model to demonstrate the operations. 1. Token Embeddings and Positional Encoding Before any attention is computed, input text is first converted into token embeddings. These embeddings are high-dimensional vectors (e.g., 768 dimensions in BERT-base) that capture word meaning. Because transformers have no inherent sense of order, it adds a positional encoding to each token embedding. The positional encoding uses sinusoidal functions: Press enter or click to view image in full size Press enter or click to view image in full size Visualization of token embeddings after applying PCA dimensionality reduction Press enter or click to view image in full size Embeddings generated by Encoder in BERT Press enter or click to view image in full size Positional Encoding Matrix This encoding is added element-wise to the token embeddings to form the final input representations X. X = Embeddings + Position Encodings 2. Computing Q, K, V Matrices From the combined input X (token embeddings + positional encoding), the transformer computes three key matrices: How Are Wq, Wk, Wv Learned? During training , the transformer model initializes random values for Wq,Wk,Wv and optimizes them using back-propagation . These matrices are updated to capture meaningful transformations of the input embeddings. The purpose of these transformations is to create distinct query, key, and value representations that influence how much each token attends to another. 3. Computing Attention Weights Once we obtain Q, K, and V , we compute attention scores by performing dot-product attention : Step 1: Compute Raw Attention Scores Each token’s query is compared against all keys to determine its attention score: Attention Scores where d_k=64 (single-head dimension) is used for scaling to prevent large values that could destabilize training. Step 2: Apply Softmax to Get Attention Weights The attention scores are passed through softmax to get probability distributions: Attention Weights = softmax(QK^T/d_k) Each row of this matrix represents how much focus each word pays to every other word. Step 3: Weighting Values (V) to Compute Output The final attention output is obtained by multiplying the attention weights with the V matrix : Attention Output = Attention Weights × V This weighted sum determines how much information flows from each word to another.

In the “new normal” imposed by covid19, a significant proportion of educational material, news, discussions happen through digital media platforms. This provides more text data available to work upon! Originally, simple RNNS (Recurrent Neural Networks) were used for training text data. But in recent years there have been many new research publications that provide state-of-the-art results. One of such is BERT! In this blog, I’ll put down my understanding of the BERT transformer and its application. BERT stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. I’ll give a brief idea about transformers first before proceeding further. Source: Image Intro to Transformers BERT is a transformer-based architecture. What is a transformer? Google introduced the transformer architecture in the paper “Attention is All you need”. Transformer uses a self-attention mechanism, which is suitable for language understanding. The need for attention can be understood with a simple example. Let’s say “I went to Horsley hills this summer and it was pretty well developed considering the last time I was there”. The last word “there” refers to the Horsley hills. But to understand this, remembering the first few parts is essential. To achieve this, the attention mechanism decides at each step of an input sequence which other parts of the sequence are important.  In simple words, “You need context!”. The transformer has an encoder-decoder architecture. They are composed of modules that contain feed-forward and attention layers.  The below image is from the research paper. Source: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf What is the need for BERT? Generally, language models read the input sequence in one direction: either left to right or right to left. This kind of one-directional training works well when the aim is to predict/generate the next word. But in order to have a deeper sense of language context, BERT uses bidirectional training . Sometimes, it’s also referred to as “non-directional”. So, it takes both the previous and next tokens into account simultaneously. BERT applies the bidirectional training of Transformer to language modeling , learns the text representations. Note that BERT is just an encoder. It does not have a decoder.  The encoder is responsible for reading text input and processing. The decoder is responsible for producing a prediction for the task. Architecture of BERT BERT is a multi-layered encoder. In that paper, two models were introduced, BERT base and BERT large. The BERT large has double the layers compared to the base model. By layers, we indicate transformer blocks. BERT-base was trained on 4 cloud-based TPUs for 4 days and BERT-large was trained on 16 TPUs for 4 days. BERT base – 12 layers, 12 attention heads, and 110 million parameters. BERT Large – 24 layers, 16 attention heads and, 340 million parameters. Source: Bert illustration As you can see from the above image, the BERT base is a stack of 12 encoders. Each of them is a transformer block. The input has to be provided to the first encoder. The BERT encoder expects a sequence of tokens. The below image shows how tokens are processed and converted. [CLS] is a special token inserted at the beginning of the first sentence.  [SEP] is inserted at the end of each sentence. We created segment embeddings by adding a segment ‘A’ or ‘B’ to distinguish between the sentences. We also add the position of each token in the sequence to get position embeddings. Source: Researchgate The sum of the above three embeddings is the final input to the BERT Encoder. BERT takes an input sequence, and it keeps traveling up the stack. At each block, it is first passed through a Self Attention layer and then to a feed-forward neural network. It is passed on to the next encoder. In the end, Each position will output a  vector of\"\n}\n**Web Page 7:**\n{\n  \"id\": 7,\n  \"title\": \"BERT Encoder Layer - Tinkerd\",\n  \"url\": \"https://tinkerd.net/blog/machine-learning/bert-encoder/\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Transformers.

This allows us to determine the similarity of meaning between two words in their respective contexts. For example, the cosine similarity between the word “fire” in the first and second sentences is 0.79: def cosine_similarity ( a , b ): result = ( tf . reduce_sum ( tf . multiply ( a , b ))) / ( tf . norm ( a , ord = 2 ) * tf . norm ( b , ord = 2 )) return result . numpy () print ( \\\"Similarity between 1 and 2: \\\" f \\\" { cosine_similarity ( encoder_embeddings_2 [ 0 , 5 ], encoder_embeddings_1 [ 0 , 5 ]) } \\\" ) Similarity between 1 and 2 : 0.7944693565368652 In the second sentence, “There was a huge fire raging through the forest” , the word “fire” refers specifically to a forest fire. Let’s create a different sentence that also refers to forest fires, and compare the resulting contextual embedding. sentence_4 = tokenizer ([ \\\"I knew the forest fire was not far off\\\" ]) embeddings_4 = model . bert . embeddings ( input_ids = sentence_4 [ \\\"input_ids\\\" ]) encoder_embeddings_4 = encoder_layer ( hidden_states = embeddings_4 , ** encoder_call_args )[ 0 ] print ( \\\"Similarity between 2 and 4: \\\" f \\\" { cosine_similarity ( encoder_embeddings_2 [ 0 , 5 ], encoder_embeddings_4 [ 0 , 5 ]) } \\\" ) Similarity between 2 and 4 : 0.9660714864730835 As you can see the similarity between the word “fire” in sentences 2 and 4 is much higher than in sentences 1 and 2. Demo: Contextual Embeddings Try encoding two sentences below, then touch any token on the left to view the cosine similarity of its embedding with each of the tokens on the right. Sentence 1 There was a huge fire raging through the forest Sentence 2 I knew the forest fire was not far off Note: This demo uses a smaller version of BERT, so the contextual embeddings produced will be slightly different than those produced by the original BERT model. Transformers The BERT Encoder is based on the Transformer architecture proposed in the paper Attention Is All You Need . Each encoder is made up of two parts: A multi-head self-attention layer, and a feed-forward neural network. Attention In order for the embedding representation of a token to become contextualized , some information about that token’s context (i.e. about the other tokens in the input sequence) must be incorporated into its embedding. This is the reponsibility of the Attention mechanism in the Encoder. To intuitively understand the concept of attention , consider the sentence from earlier: There was a huge fire raging through the forest When we were only given the word fire , it was impossible to discern the meaning of this word within the context of the sentence. However, by seeing the entire sentence it is clear that the word fire refers to a forest fire. But what exactly about the sentence makes this meaning clear? And do we actually need to see the entire sentence to reach this conclusion? In most cases, it is not necessary to see the entire sentence to determine the meaning of a particular word. For example, given two additional words (“raging” and “forest”), the meaning of fire in the text becomes fairly clear: ____ ____ ____ ____ fire raging ____ ____ forest If, however, you were given the words “was” and “the”, then the meaning of fire still remains opaque: ____ was ____ ____ fire ____ ____ the ____ This is all to say that, when ascertaining the meaning of the word fire in this sentence, we pay more attention to certain words (i.e. “raging” and\"\n}\n**Web Page 8:**\n{\n  \"id\": 8,\n  \"title\": \"A Complete Guide to BERT with Code | Towards Data Science\",\n  \"url\": \"https://towardsdatascience.com/a-complete-guide-to-bert-with-code-9f87602e4a11/\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"This has been created by adapting the architecture diagram from the original Transformer paper \\\"Attention is All You Need\\\" [2].

HOME BLOG ARCHIVES OPEN SOURCE VIDEOS heidloff.net - Building is my Passion Post Cancel Foundation Models, Transformers, BERT and GPT Posted Feb 24, 2023 Updated Nov 25, 2024 By Niklas Heidloff 7 min read Since I’m excited by the incredible capabilities which technologies like ChatGPT and Bard provide, I’m trying to understand better how they work. This post summarizes my current understanding about foundation models, transformers, BERT and GPT. Note that I’m only learning these concepts and not everything might be fully correct but might help some people to understand the high level concepts. I know that there are many more and more modern Foundation Models than BERT and GPT , but I want to start ‘simple’ and these two models are probably the most known ones these days. The technologies below are not trivial and there are lots of articles, papers and full courses even on certain aspects of each technology only. Instead of going into detail, I try to explain what they do and what concepts they use. Foundation Models BERT and GPT are both foundation models. Let’s look at the definition and characteristics: Pre-trained on different types of unlabeled datasets (e.g., language and images) Self-supervised learning Generalized data representations which can be used in multiple downstream tasks (e.g., classification and generation) The Transformer architecture is mostly used, but not mandatory Read my blog Foundation Models at IBM to find out more. Transformer Architecture Most foundation models use the transformer architecture. Let’s look at the definition : A transformer is a deep learning model that adopts the mechanism of self-attention, differentially weighting the significance of each part of the input data. It is used primarily in the fields of natural language processing and computer vision. In 2017 transformers were introduced: Attention is all you need . They are the next generation of Recurrent Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory architectures and have several benefits: Parallel processing: Increases performance and scalability Bidirectionality: Allows understanding of ambiguous words and coreferences The original transformer architecture defines two main parts, an encoder and a decoder. However, not all foundation models use both parts. BERT only uses encoders, GPT only decoders. More on this later. Attention Both encoders and decoders use the concept of ‘attention’. Attention basically means to focus on the important pieces of information and to blend out the unimportant pieces. I like to compare this with ‘fast reading’. Rather than reading full articles or even full books, I often browse chapter titles, first words of paragraphs and scan paragraphs for keywords to find what I’m looking for. The words of an article, the parts of an image or the words in a sentence that should get most attention change dependent on what you are looking for. Let’s look at a simple example sentence: “Sarah went to a restaurant to meet her friend that night.” The following words should get attention for the following queries: What? -> ‘went’, ‘meet’ Where? -> ‘a restaurant’ Who? -> ‘Sarah’, ‘her friend’ When? -> ‘that night’ To determine the attention of words (more exactly tokens) ‘queries’, ‘keys’ and ‘values’ are used by encoders and decoders in transformers. All of them are presented in vectors. Keys are found for certain queries if they are closest to the query vector. Keys are an encoded representation for values, in simple cases they can be the same. There are different algorithms to implement the attention concept. I think an easy way to understand how this can work is to rank words high that are often used together in sentences. For example, ‘where’ and ‘restaurant’ have probably a closer relation than ‘restaurant’ and ‘faith’. So, for the query ‘where’ the word ‘restaurant’ gets more attention. Encoders and Decoders As mentioned, there are encoders and decoders. BERT uses encoders only, GTP uses decoders only. Both options understand language including syntax and semantics. Especially the next generation of large language models like GPT with billions of parameters do this very well. The two models focus on different scenarios. However, since the field of foundation models is evolving, the differentiation is often fuzzier. BERT (encoder): classification (e.g., sentiment), questions and answers, summarization, named entity recognition GPT (decoder): translation, generation (e.g., stories) The outputs of the core models are different: BERT (encoder): Embeddings representing words with attention information in a certain context GPT (decoder): Next words with probabilities Both models are pretrained and can be reused without intensive training. Some of them are available as open source and can be downloaded from communities like Hugging Face, others are commercial. Reuse is important, since training\"\n}\n"

Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Constraints:**\n   - There are 30 coins in total.\n   - One box must contain at least 2 coins.\n   - One box must contain 6 more coins than another box.\n   - Bob must guess the number of coins in each of the three boxes.\n\n2. **Possible Distributions:**\n   - Let's denote the number of coins in the three boxes as \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) such that \\(a + b + c = 30\\).\n   - We need to find a distribution where one box has 6 more coins than another, and one box has at least 2 coins.\n\n3. **Exploring Possible Distributions:**\n   - Suppose \\(a \\leq b \\leq c\\).\n   - If \\(c = b + 6\\), then we have \\(a + b + (b + 6) = 30\\), simplifying to \\(a + 2b + 6 = 30\\), or \\(a + 2b = 24\\).\n   - Since \\(a \\leq b \\leq c\\), \\(a\\) must be at least 2. Let's explore the possible values for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):\n     - If \\(a = 2\\), then \\(2 + 2b = 24\\), giving \\(2b = 22\\), so \\(b = 11\\). This gives \\(c = 17\\). So one possible distribution is \\(2, 11, 17\\).\n     - If \\(a = 4\\), then \\(4 + 2b = 24\\), giving \\(2b = 20\\), so \\(b = 10\\). This gives \\(c = 16\\). So another possible distribution is \\(4, 10, 16\\).\n     - If \\(a = 6\\), then \\(6 + 2b = 24\\), giving \\(2b = 18\\), so \\(b = 9\\). This gives \\(c = 15\\). So another possible distribution is \\(6, 9, 15\\).\n\n4. **Optimal Strategy:**\n   - Bob needs to guess the number of coins in each box. The optimal strategy would be to guess the smallest possible number that guarantees a win for each box.\n   - For the box with 2 coins, the smallest guess is 2.\n   - For the box with 11 coins, the smallest guess is 11.\n   - For the box with 17 coins, the smallest guess is 17.\n\n5. **Calculating the Minimum Win:**\n   - If Bob guesses 2 for the box with 2 coins, he wins 2 coins.\n   - If Bob guesses 11 for the box with 11 coins, he wins 11 coins.\n   - If Bob guesses 17 for the box with 17 coins, he wins 17 coins.\n   - The total minimum win is \\(2 + 11 + 17 = 30\\).\n\nTherefore, the minimum amount of money Bob can win from the game is \\(\\boxed{30000}\\) dollars.",

        "turn_1_reason": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the constraints and the optimal strategy for Bob. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Constraints:**\n   - There are 30 coins in total.\n   - One box must contain at least 2 coins.\n   - One box must contain 6 more coins than another box.\n   - Bob must guess the number of coins in each of the three boxes.\n\n2. **Possible Distributions:**\n   - Let's denote the number of coins in the three boxes as \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) such that \\(a + b + c = 30\\).\n   - We need to find a distribution where one box has 6 more coins than another, and one box has at least 2 coins.\n\n3. **Exploring Possible Distributions:**\n   - Suppose \\(a \\leq b \\leq c\\).\n   - If \\(c = b + 6\\), then we have \\(a + b + (b + 6) = 30\\), simplifying to \\(a + 2b + 6 = 30\\), or \\(a + 2b = 24\\).\n   - Since \\(a \\leq b \\leq c\\), \\(a\\) must be at least 2. Let's explore the possible values for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):\n     - If \\(a = 2\\), then \\(2 + 2b = 24\\), giving \\(2b = 22\\), so \\(b = 11\\). This gives \\(c = 17\\). So one possible distribution is \\(2, 11, 17\\).\n     - If \\(a = 4\\), then \\(4 + 2b = 24\\), giving \\(2b = 20\\), so \\(b = 10\\). This gives \\(c = 16\\). So another possible distribution is \\(4, 10, 16\\).\n     - If \\(a = 6\\), then \\(6 + 2b = 24\\), giving \\(2b = 18\\), so \\(b = 9\\). This gives \\(c = 15\\).

        "Steps": "1. I start with the first line, \"T H E S E\" and proceed to the next, \"A G U L L\". At this point, I am able to discern that \"A G U L L\" is probably meant to be \"A GULL\". However, I continue to read through the rest of the lines to get a sense of any other words that might jump out that would substantiate \"A GULL\" being accurate both semantically and syntactically. 2. So now I am on the last line and decide to work backwards. \"CHAIR\" is on the last line all by itself and this does seem a plausible fit as a full word rather than a fragment of another word. When I look to the line directly above \"Y T O M Y\", the word \"my\" jumps out and this is a natural accompaniment to the noun often used to indicate possession. \n3. Eliminating the \"MY\" at the end of \"Y T O MY\" leaves \"Y T O\" remaining in the line and I immediately recognize the preposition \"TO\". It is a this point I am fairly confident that \"TO MY CHAIR\" is most likely accurate. Given that there is only a \"Y\" left, I discern it is more than likely the end of a word located in the row above.\n4. I am now on the fifth row down and am looking at the letters \"E F U L L\" Attaching the \"Y\" left over from the sixth row below I see \"E F U L L Y\"  I recognize the word \"FULLY\" I know it can stand alone as an adverb or it can serve as a suffix to a larger adverb.\n5. Detaching the \"FULLY\", leaves the \"E\" alone on the line. Knowing it does not represent a word on its own in the English language, I look to attach it to the line above (row 4).\n6. The fourth row reads \"D P E A C\". Adding the \"E\" to the end, the first word I can separate out is \"ACE\". However \"ACEFULLY\" is not a word nor does \"ACE FULLY TO MY CHAIR\" make sense. When working my way left through the line, continuing to attach each letter as I go, I land on the \"P\" and am fairly confident that the word is \"PEACEFULLY\".\n7. Eliminating the \"PEAC\" from the row leaves me left with a \"D\". Now I look at the row above, row 3 and see that the row comprises the word \"GLIDE\" Adding the \"D\" to the end of the word would not only be permissible in terms of a displaying appropriate tense but it also makes sense as I add it to the fragment I have so far. I now can read \"GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR\".\n8. Now, I am on the second line and if I were to read it from there on down it would read \"A GULL GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR\".  While this reads well and makes sense semantically and syntactically on its own, it does not make sense when I add the first row. THESE A GULL GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR.  So now I am left with the conclusion that  \"A GULL\" is not correct. Either it is part of a larger word or the letters need to be broken down further. At a quick glace, I can see that they don't make sense being broken down further so I leave \"GULL\" and add the \"A\" to the string above. Immediately my eye sees that \"A can be added to \"SE\" to make \"SEA\" and that the remaining\nletters spell the word \"THE\"  I now know the sentence reads \"The seagull glided peacefully to my chair.",

Both appointments as acting secretary were found invalid by the Government Accountability Office in August 2020, and by a federal judge in November 2020. Ken Cuccinelli was appointed acting Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in June 2019, and Acting Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security in November 2019. The first appointment was ruled invalid by a federal judge in March 2020; the second was found invalid by GAO in August 2020. Beginning in 2019, multiple appointments of acting officials in the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) were questioned on the basis of whether the appointments were legal under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 and the Homeland Security Act of 2002 . After the departure of Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in April 2019, the Trump administration did not formally nominate a new secretary to be confirmed by the Senate, relying on acting postings. [ 1 ] The disputed appointments were those of Kevin McAleenan and Chad Wolf as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security , and Ken Cuccinelli as Senior Official Performing the Duties of both the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security and the Director of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The dispute on the Secretary and Deputy Secretary appointments centered on the fact that the issued text of an amendment to the order of succession deviated from the intention of then-Secretary Nielsen, placing a different person than expected next in line. The dispute on the USCIS appointment centered on whether a newly created Principal Deputy Director position was validly the \\\"first assistant\\\" to the Director under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. On March 1, 2020, the District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Cuccinelli was not lawfully appointed to serve as acting USCIS Director and invalidated certain actions taken by him; the government dropped its appeal of this case in August 2020. On August 14, 2020, the Government Accountability Office released a finding that McAleenan, Wolf, and Cuccinelli had been appointed improperly to their Acting Secretary and Deputy Secretary positions; the DHS rejected this finding. On November 14, 2020, the District Court for the Eastern District of New York ruled that Wolf was not lawfully serving as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security and overturned all of his orders as lacking \\\"legal authority\\\". [ 2 ] Wolf resigned his post on January 11, 2021, after a number of similar court rulings. [ 3 ] From 2020 to 2021, similar concerns were raised about Christopher C. Miller served as acting United States secretary of defense . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Background [ edit ] The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 (FVRA) specified procedures for filling vacant offices, allowing the President to direct a person serving in a different Senate-confirmed position to serve as acting officer. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (HSA) established the Department of Homeland Security and the position of the Secretary of Homeland Security . The line of succession to the Secretary was specified through a series of executive orders , the most recent of which was Executive Order 13753 of December 9, 2016, which specified the line of succession when the Secretary had \\\"died, resigned, or otherwise become unable to perform the functions and duties of the office of Secretary\\\". [ 6 ] [ 8 ] The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 , signed into law on December 23, 2016, amended the HSA to create new procedures for specifying the line of succession for the Secretary as an exception to the procedures in the FVRA. Specifically, it specified that the Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Management must be third in line to the Secretary position, and second in line to the Deputy Secretary position. It also allowed the Secretary rather than the President to specify the further lines of succession, and did not specify a time limit to the eligibility of acting officials as the FVRA had done. [ 6 ] [ 9 ] The Secretary specified succession through DHS Delegation 00106, which went through a number of revisions. By February 2019, it stated that Executive Order 13753 still held in the case of death, resignation, or\"\n}\n**Web Page 2:**\n{\n  \"id\": 2,\n  \"title\": \"Top Homeland Security Officials Are Serving Illegally, G.A.O.

Wolf, the acting secretary of homeland security,  began after Kirstjen Nielsen was forced out of office as the secretary in April 2019. Credit... Gabriella Demczuk for The New York Times By Michael D. Shear Aug. 14, 2020 WASHINGTON — President Trump’s top two officials at the Department of Homeland Security are illegally serving in their positions, with appointments that violated the laws governing who can fill Senate-confirmed posts, according to a report released Friday by the Government Accountability Office. Chad F. Wolf , the acting secretary of homeland security, and Kenneth T. Cuccinelli, his deputy at the sprawling agency, are serving in violation of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, which specifies orders of succession when senior officials resign, according to the G.A.O., Congress’s nonpartisan watchdog. The report said the improper appointments began after Kirstjen Nielsen was forced out of office as the department’s secretary in April 2019. “Because the incorrect official assumed the title of acting secretary at that time, subsequent amendments to the order of succession made by that official were invalid,” the Government Accountability Office said on Friday. The agency said that Mr. Wolf and Mr. Cuccinelli “are serving under an invalid order of succession.” The report follows a similar finding in March by a federal judge , who ruled that Mr. Cuccinelli’s appointment violated federal law and that two policies he put in place while he served in the position should be nullified. “Cuccinelli’s appointment fails to comply with the F.V.R.A. for a more fundamental and clear-cut reason,” the judge, Randolph D. Moss of the United States District Court in Washington, said in his ruling. The Government Accountability Office does not have the ability to enforce its findings on the Trump administration, which has repeatedly defended its appointments of Mr. Wolf and Mr. Cuccinelli. In a statement, the watchdog said that it was referring the issue to the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general and to Congress, which could try to force their removals. Legal experts said the report would help bolster several court cases, including the one in Judge Moss’s court, in which the appointments are being challenged. “Holy cow: The *GAO* has determined that Chad Wolf was not lawfully named the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security, and that @HomelandKen (who already is using an inappropriate title) wasn’t lawfully appointed even to his *proper* position at DHS,” Stephen I. Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, whose work includes studying the Vacancies Act, wrote on Twitter . “This is a remarkably big deal,” he added. In a statement, the White House made clear that it had no intention of acting on the watchdog’s findings. “D.H.S. is expressly authorized by Congress in the Homeland Security Act to designate its acting secretaries,” Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, said. “G.A.O. is not. And G.A.O.’s opinion substituting its views for that of the agency’s is not only wrong, but laughable.” The White House has ignored such findings before. Last year, an independent government agency said Mr. Trump should fire Kellyanne Conway , his White House counselor, for repeated violations of an ethics law, the Hatch Act, which bars partisan politics from the federal workplace. The recommendation by the agency, called the Office of Special Counsel , went nowhere. But Democrats tried to press the case. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said that any policy decisions made by Mr. Wolf or Mr. Cuccinelli should be nullified, and that the men should step down. “President Trump’s efforts to install political sycophants to implement his extreme policies in an end run around the law and Senate have finally caught up with him,” Mr. Schumer said in a statement. “The determination by an independent congressional watchdog today invalidates actions Mr. Cuccinelli and Mr. \"\n}\n**Web Page 3:**\n{\n  \"id\": 3,\n  \"title\": \"Trump to nominate acting Homeland Security secretary Chad Wolf to ...\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/25/politics/chad-wolf-homeland-security-secretary\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"... positions at Homeland Security have been left vacant or filled in an acting capacity.

Under the Trump administration, the department, which is often at the center of the President’s policy and policy initiatives has been plagued by leadership turmoil. Numerous top positions at Homeland Security have been left vacant or filled in an acting capacity. Wolf has been the acting secretary since November 2019. The department has not had a confirmed secretary since April 2019 when former Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was forced to resign. Ken Cuccinelli and Chad Wolf Getty Images Related article Government watchdog reaffirms Homeland Security leadership appointments were invalid Wolf has been at the forefront of a host of issues like immigration, civil unrest, and response to the coronavirus pandemic, and as a result, has come under criticism for his actions. During Wolf’s 10-month tenure, the department has been marked by a focus on the border wall, a fight with New York over Global Entry and most recently a deployment of federal officers to Portland, Oregon, in opposition to local officials. Trump has repeatedly lavished praise on Wolf during recent news conferences. “I am pleased to inform the American Public that Acting Secretary Chad Wolf will be nominated to be the Secretary of Homeland Security. Chad has done an outstanding job and we greatly appreciate his service!” Trump tweeted Tuesday. Wolf was confirmed by the Senate as under secretary for the Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans almost immediately before becoming acting secretary of the full department. But the Government Accountability Office, a watchdog for Congress, said in a report earlier this month that Wolf’s appointment and that of Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli – the top two leadership roles at DHS – are invalid. The department has disputed the GAO conclusion, calling for the agency to “immediately rescind” the report. “This nomination is a clear admission that the Administration is installed Mr. Wolf as Acting Secretary unlawfully,” said House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat. “Since every policy decision Mr. Wolf made since November may be challenged because he lacked proper authority, this is also an attempt to limit the Administration’s exposure to legal challenges.” Wolf will remain the acting secretary under the authority of the Homeland Security Act, according to a DHS official. “The President has the right to nominate anyone he wants to be DHS Secretary, including Wolf – whether or not he’s lawfully serving currently as the Acting Secretary. Indeed, this is the way the system is supposed to work – on the 503rd straight day without a Senate-confirmed Secretary,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN analyst and professor at the University\"\n}\n**Web Page 4:**\n{\n  \"id\": 4,\n  \"title\": \"DHS Statement on Recent Challenges to Acting Secretary Wolf's ...\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-statement-recent-challenges-acting-secretary-wolfs-authority\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Acting Secretary Chad Wolf continues to exercise authority as the head of the Department of Homeland Security in line with the succession orders issued by ...\",\n  \"context\": \"e .gov websites use HTTPS A lock ( Lock A locked padlock )\\n                or https:// means you’ve safely connected to the .gov website.

On the basis of those orders, since November 2019, Acting Secretary Wolf has exercised the lawful authority to take actions that are the subject of current litigation challenges. Acting Secretary McAleenan lawfully issued a number of actions on the basis of his authority via the Nielsen succession order that are also the subject of current litigation. Given the issuance of the Nielsen and McAleenan succession orders, no ratifications of prior Acting Secretary Wolf and former Acting Secretary McAleenan actions are necessary. Nevertheless, out of an abundance of caution and to minimize any potential disruption to the Department and the Administration’s Homeland Security mission, the Department has taken alternative action to re-confirm Acting Secretary Wolf’s lawful exercise of authority, even if Executive Order 13753 issued in December 2016 were to have remained the governing succession order for the Department. On November 14, 2020, Peter Gaynor, the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), exercised any authority of the position of Acting Secretary that he had to designate an order of succession under 6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(2). This occurred after the President submitted Acting Secretary Wolf’s nomination to the Senate on September 10, 2020, and provides an alternative basis for Acting Secretary Wolf’s authority. Mr. Gaynor’s order re-issued the order of succession established by former Acting Secretary McAleenan on November 8, 2019, and placed the Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans above the FEMA Administrator in the order of succession. Once Mr. Gaynor’s order was executed, it superseded any authority Mr. Gaynor may have had under the Federal Vacancy Reform Act and confirmed Acting Secretary Wolf’s authority to continue to serve as the Acting Secretary. After Mr. Gaynor signed the November 14, 2020 order, out of an abundance of caution and to minimize any disruption to the Department and the Administration’s Homeland Security mission, Acting Secretary Wolf ratified any and all of his own actions taken since November 13, 2019, as well as certain actions taken by former Acting Secretary McAleenan. The Department continues to evaluate its legal options in these cases and is working to ensure the Administration’s challenged policies and regulations remain in effect. Attachment Ext.

This is the most recent proceeding in the ongoing dispute over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (\\\"DACA\\\") program and the Trump Administration's efforts to end it. On July 28, 2020, Defendant Chad F. Wolf issued a memorandum that effec­ tively suspended DACA pending the Department of Homeland Security's (\\\"DHS\\\") review of the program, following the Supreme Court's decision in Dep't of Homeland Security v. Regents of the Univ. of California, 140 S. Ct. 1891 (2020). Plaintiffs in two re­ lated cases, Batalla Vidal v. Wolf, 16-cv-4756, and State of New York v. Trump, 17-cv-5228,1 moved for leave to challenge the memorandum on the grounds (1) that Mr. Wolf was not lawfully serving as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security and therefore did not have authority to issue the memorandum; and (2) that the memorandum was arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (\\\"APA\\\").

The GAO report came at the request of the heads of the House Homeland Security Committee and the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. \\\"Messrs. Wolf and Cuccinelli were named to their respective positions of Acting Secretary and Senior Official Performing the Duties of Deputy Secretary by reference to an invalid order of succession,\\\" the GAO said. It declined to draw conclusions about the consequences of their service, saying it had not been asked. The succession problem arose in the wake of the resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in April 2019. Kevin McAleenan, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, became acting secretary. He held the job until November, when he resigned and Wolf rose to become acting secretary. The GAO said the Homeland Security Act established its own succession rules for department positions requiring Senate approval. Under the leadership of Wolf and Cuccinelli, the Department of Homeland Security has attracted intense scrutiny for such actions as deploying federal agents to protests in Portland, Ore., over the opposition of local and state leaders. And new restrictions on asylum-seekers and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, applicants have prompted lawsuits from immigration advocates. Some of those lawsuits seek to throw out DHS actions on the grounds that the department's leadership is not legitimately in power. And now a government body has endorsed that legal argument, which, O'Connell said, \\\"could be very persuasive in the courts.\\\" Although the GAO's opinion is not binding on DHS or on the court system, the opinion could prompt judges to dismiss some DHS actions as illegal, and it also suggests it is not clear who has the legal authority to run the department.

Before Nielsen, **Jeh Johnson** was Secretary from 2013 to 2017. The provided web pages confirm that Nielsen was the last confirmed Secretary before April 2019, and subsequent leadership roles (e.g., Kevin McAleenan and Chad Wolf) were held in acting capacities, which are excluded per the search query. Earlier Secretaries like **Janet Napolitano** (2009–2013) and **Michael Chertoff** (2005–2009) are also included in the formal list, though they predate the timeframe emphasized in the search results. The key takeaway from the searched pages is that **Kirstjen Nielsen** was the most recent formal Secretary prior to April 2019."

(B) Proceedings Exempt from Initial Disclosure. The following proceedings are exempt from initial disclosure: (i) an action for review on an administrative record; (ii) a forfeiture action in rem arising from a federal statute; (iii) a petition for habeas corpus or any other proceeding to challenge a criminal conviction or sentence; (iv) an action brought without an attorney by a person in the custody of the United States, a state, or a state subdivision; (v) an action to enforce or quash an administrative summons or subpoena; (vi) an action by the United States to recover benefit payments; (vii) an action by the United States to collect on a student loan guaranteed by the United States; (viii) a proceeding ancillary to a proceeding in another court; and (ix) an action to enforce an arbitration award.

In ruling on the objection, the court must determine what disclosures, if any, are to be made and must set the time for disclosure. (D) Time for Initial Disclosures—For Parties Served or Joined Later. A party that is first served or otherwise joined after the\\n         \\n          Rule 26(f)\\n         \\n         conference must make the initial disclosures within 30 days after being served or joined, unless a different time is set by stipulation or court order. (E) Basis for Initial Disclosure; Unacceptable Excuses. A party must make its initial disclosures based on the information then reasonably available to it. A party is not excused from making its disclosures because it has not fully investigated the case or because it challenges the sufficiency of another party's disclosures or because another party has not made its disclosures.

In addition to the disclosures required by\\n         \\n          Rule 26(a)(1)\\n         \\n         , a party must disclose to the other parties the identity of any witness it may use at trial to present evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 , 703 , or 705 . (B) Witnesses Who Must Provide a Written Report. Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, this disclosure must be accompanied by a written report—prepared and signed by the witness—if the witness is one retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony in the case or one whose duties as the party's employee regularly involve giving expert testimony. The report must contain: (i) a complete statement of all opinions the witness will express and the basis and reasons for them; (ii) the facts or data considered by the witness in forming them; (iii) any exhibits that will be used to summarize or support them; (iv) the witness's qualifications, including a list of all publications authored in the previous 10 years; (v) a list of all other cases in which, during the previous 4 years, the witness testified as an expert at trial or by deposition; and (vi) a statement of the compensation to be paid for the study and testimony in the case. (C) Witnesses Who Do Not Provide a Written Report. Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, if the witness is not required to provide a written report, this disclosure must state: (i) the subject matter on which the witness is expected to present evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 , 703 , or 705 ; and (ii) a summary of the facts and opinions to which the witness is expected to testify. (D) Time to Disclose Expert Testimony. A party must make these disclosures at the times and in the sequence that the court orders. Absent a stipulation or a court order, the disclosures must be made: (i) at least 90 days before the date set for trial or for the case to be ready for trial; or (ii) if the evidence is intended solely to contradict or rebut evidence on the same subject matter identified by another party under\\n         \\n          Rule 26(a)(2)(B)\\n         \\n         or (C), within 30 days after the other party's disclosure.

Here’s a summary and explanation: Qualifications of Expert Witnesses : The rule requires that the witness must be qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education. Basis of Expert Testimony : The expert’s testimony must be based on sufficient facts or data. This ensures that the expert’s opinion is well-grounded and not speculative. Reliability of Methods : The testimony must be the product of reliable principles and methods. The expert must apply these principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case. This requirement is to ensure that the expert’s testimony is based on sound scientific or technical reasoning. Relevance and Fit : The expert testimony must assist the trier of fact (such as the jury) to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. This means the testimony must be relevant to the case and provide meaningful insight into issues that require expert knowledge. Gatekeeping Role of the Judge : Under Rule 702, the judge acts as a gatekeeper to ensure that expert testimony is not only relevant but also reliable. This involves assessing the methodology and principles underlying the expert’s opinion. Rule 702 is crucial in ensuring that expert testimony provided in court is both reliable and relevant. It guards against the misuse of expert testimony that might otherwise unduly influence the jury or decision-maker with ungrounded scientific claims or technical jargon. This rule upholds the integrity of the legal process by allowing expert testimony that can genuinely contribute to resolving complex issues in a case. History (Pub. L. 93â595, Â§1, Jan. 2, 1975, 88 Stat. 1937; Apr. 17, 2000, eff. Dec. 1, 2000; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011; Apr. 24, 2023, eff. Dec 1, 2023.) Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules An intelligent evaluation of facts is often difficult or impossible without the application of some scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge. The most common source of this knowledge is the expert witness, although there are other techniques for supplying it. Most of the literature assumes that experts testify only in the form of opinions. The assumption is logically unfounded. The rule accordingly recognizes that an expert on the stand may give a dissertation or exposition of scientific or other principles relevant to the case, leaving the trier of fact to apply them to the facts. Since much of the criticism of expert testimony has centered upon the hypothetical question, it seems wise to recognize that opinions are not indispensable and to encourage the use of expert testimony in non-opinion form when counsel believes the trier can itself draw the requisite infe\"\n}\n**Web Page 7:**\n{\n  \"id\": 7,\n  \"title\": \"[PDF] Modernizing the Potent, But Overlooked, Rule of Witness ...\",\n  \"url\": \"https://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3912&context=wmlr\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Witness sequestration requires multiple witnesses to be examined separately to prevent them from tailoring their testimony to ensure consistency.\",\n  \"context\": \"WWiilllliiaamm && MMaarryy LLaaww RReevviieeww Volume 63 (2021-2022) Article 2 Issue 1 10-2021 \\\"\\\"TThhee\\\"\\\" RRuullee:: MMooddeerrnniizziinngg tthhee PPootteenntt,, BBuutt OOvveerrllooookkeedd,, RRuullee ooff WWiittnneessss SSeeqquueessttrraattiioonn Daniel J.

The rule of witness sequestration demands that multiple witnesses to the same events be examined separately from one another to prevent them from, con- sciously or subconsciously, tailoring their testimony to ensure that it remains consistent. Witness sequestration is conceptually simplistic and famously mighty. Yet, this bedrock protection against inaccurate trial testimony is imperiled by conflicting interpretations of Federal * Philip Reed Professor of Law, Fordham Law School.

In some circuits, the Rule is narrowly construed in accordance with its plain language to prohibit witnesses only from remaining physically present in the courtroom during testimony. Under this view, the Rule offers no protection against testimonial tailoring outside the courtroom. Yet, remaining physically present during the testimony of other witnesses is not the only means by which a prospective witness might adapt her testimony to match that of other witnesses. Although extra-tribunal witness coordination has always been possible, the explosion in technology and the recent specter of COVID-19 have multiplied exponentially options for testi- monial tailoring beyond the courtroom doors. For this reason, some circuits construe terse “Rule 615” orders broadly to prohibit witness collaboration and access to testimony beyond the trial setting. Although these circuits afford the full complement of sequestration protection, their expansive construction of succinct “Rule 615” orders generates fairness concerns about inadequate notice of proscribed witness behavior. This Article details the competing interpretations of Rule 615 orders adopted by the federal courts and examines the merits and demerits of each approach. It further elucidates the philo- sophical divide reflected in the circuit split, exposing the textualist and purposive theories of rule construction animating the opposing views. The Article ultimately proposes detailed alternatives for re- vising Rule 615, offering draft language that could be adopted to memorialize either of the federal approaches to witness sequestration in amended rule text. “[S]equestration is (next to cross-examination) one of the greatest engines that the skill of man has ever invented for the detection of liars in a court of justice.”1 1. 6 JOHNHENRY WIGMORE, WIGMORE ON EVIDENCE:EVIDENCE IN TRIALS AT COMMON LAW § 1838 (Arthur Best ed., 4th ed. 2021).2021] “THE” RULE: WITNESS SEQUESTRATION 3 TABLE OF CONTENTS\"\n}\n**Web Page 8:**\n{\n  \"id\": 8,\n  \"title\": \"2020-2021 Updates to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.federalrulesofcivilprocedure.org/2020-2021-updates-to-the-federal-rules-of-civil-procedure/\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"The foregoing amendment to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure shall take effect on December 1, 2020, and shall govern in all proceedings in civil cases ...\",\n  \"context\": \"2020-2021 Updates to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure | Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Skip to content Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 2024 Edition Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 2024 Edition Main Menu 2020-2021 Updates to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure By admin / December 9, 2020 SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Proposed amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 30, absent contrary Congressional action Effective December 1, 2020 Honorable Nancy Pelosi Speaker of the House of Representatives Washington, DC 20515 Dear Madam Speaker: I have the honor to submit to the Congress an amendment to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that has been adopted by the Supreme Court of the United States pursuant to Section 2072 of Title 28, United States Code.

Key rules include:  1. **Rule 601 (Competency to Testify in General)**  2. **Rule 602 (Need for Personal Knowledge)**  3. **Rule 603 (Oath or Affirmation to Testify Truthfully)**  4. **Rule 604 (Interpreter)**  5. **Rule 605 (Judge’s Competency as a Witness)**  6. **Rule 606 (Juror’s Competency as a Witness)**  7. **Rule 607 (Who May Impeach a Witness)**  8. **Rule 608 (A Witness’s Character for Truthfulness or Untruthfulness)**  9. **Rule 609 (Impeachment by Evidence of a Criminal Conviction)**  10. **Rule 610 (Religious Beliefs or Opinions)**  11. **Rule 611 (Mode and Order of Examining Witnesses and Presenting Evidence)**  12. **Rule 612 (Writing Used to Refresh a Witness’s Memory)**  13. **Rule 613 (Witness’s Prior Statement)**  14. **Rule 614 (Court’s Calling or Examining a Witness)**  15. **Rule 615 (Excluding Witnesses from the Courtroom; Preventing an Excluded Witness's Access to Trial Testimony)**  These rules collectively form the core provisions governing witness-related testimony in federal courts. Other rules like **Rule 702 (Expert Witnesses)** and **Rule 615** also reference witnesses but are part of the broader Evidence Rules framework. In contrast, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (e.g., Rule 26) mention witnesses in procedural contexts but lack titles with repeated explicit references to \"witnesses.\"  **Conclusion:** The **Federal Rules of Evidence (Article VI: WITNESSES)** hold the most titles explicitly mentioning \"witnesses\" as of 2021."

Birthplaces [ edit ] Twenty-one states have the distinction of being the birthplace of a president. One president's birth state is in dispute; North and South Carolina (British colonies at the time) both lay claim to Andrew Jackson , who was born in 1767 in the Waxhaw region along their common border. Jackson himself considered South Carolina his birth state. [ 1 ] Born on December 5, 1782, Martin Van Buren was the first president born an American citizen (and not a British subject ). [ 2 ] The term Virginia dynasty is sometimes used to describe the fact that four of the first five U.S. presidents were from Virginia. The number of presidents per state in which they were born, counting Jackson as being from South Carolina, are: One: Arkansas , California , Connecticut , Georgia , Hawaii , Illinois , Iowa , Kentucky , Missouri , Nebraska , New Hampshire , New Jersey , and South Carolina Two: North Carolina , Pennsylvania , Texas , and Vermont Four: Massachusetts Five: New York Seven: Ohio Eight: Virginia Date of birth President Birthplace State † of birth In office February 22, 1732 George Washington Popes Creek Virginia † (1st) April 30, 1789 – March 4, 1797 October 30, 1735 John Adams Braintree Massachusetts † (2nd) March 4, 1797 – March 4, 1801 April 13, 1743 * Thomas Jefferson Shadwell Virginia † (3rd) March 4, 1801 – March 4, 1809 March 16, 1751 James Madison Port Conway Virginia † (4th) March 4, 1809 – March 4, 1817 April 28, 1758 James Monroe Monroe Hall Virginia † (5th) March 4, 1817 – March 4, 1825 March 15, 1767 Andrew Jackson Waxhaws Region South Carolina † (7th) March 4, 1829 – March 4, 1837 July 11, 1767 John Quincy Adams Braintree Massachusetts † (6th) March 4, 1825 – March 4, 1829 February 9, 1773 William Henry Harrison Charles City County Virginia † (9th) March 4, 1841 – April 4, 1841 December 5, 1782 Martin Van Buren Kinderhook New York (8th) March 4, 1837 – March 4, 1841 November 24, 1784 Zachary Taylor Barboursville Virginia (12th) March 4, 1849 – July 9, 1850 March 29, 1790 John Tyler Charles City County Virginia (10th) April 4, 1841 – March 4, 1845 April 23, 1791 James Buchanan Cove Gap Pennsylvania (15th) March 4, 1857 – March 4, 1861 November 2, 1795 James K.

As we near Presidents' Day on Feb. 15, just weeks after a presidential inauguration, we look at where our presidents were born and how many places in the United States carry their names. Places include counties, cities, towns and minor civil divisions . George Washington, who took the oath on April 30, 1789, tops the list of presidential namesakes with at least 94 places that share his name. George Washington, who took the oath on April 30, 1789, tops the list of presidential namesakes with at least 94 places that share his name. Every other president, except for Dwight Eisenhower and our most recent – Biden, Donald Trump and Barack Obama — have places that share their names, too. (A ghost town named Trump in Colorado disappeared in the 1930s.) Second on the list of places with presidential monikers is Abraham Lincoln (72), followed by Andrew Jackson (67) and Thomas Jefferson (62). Five names show up twice because we had different presidents with the same last name: John Adams and John Quincy Adams; William Henry Harrison and Benjamin Harrison; Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt; Andrew Johnson and Lyndon Johnson; George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. Adams, Roosevelt and Bush were related but there is one more name that appears twice but belongs to one man: Cleveland, as in Grover Cleveland, who was our 22nd and 24th president. So, while Biden is the 46th president, he is the 45th person to be president. Fun Facts Of the 45 men who have been or are president of the United States, a third (15) came from just two states: eight from Virginia and seven from Ohio. Many presidents (29) were born in states that were colonies or former colonies. While there were 13 colonies, 15 states were former colonies because Maine was then part of Massachusetts and Vermont was part of New York. The top five presidents with matching county names are: Washington (31), Jefferson (26), Jackson (24), Lincoln (24) and Madison (20). Of the 3,143 counties in the United States, 298 match presidential names. Only eight presidents were born west of the Mississippi. The president born farthest west? Barack Obama in Hawaii. Even though we may think of Ronald Reagan as a Californian because he served as governor of that state, he was born in Illinois. Richard Nixon, however, was born in California and is the only president from the West Coast. Derick Moore is a senior communications specialist at the Census Bureau.

Contents 1 Birth places 2 States of primary affiliation 3 See also 4 References Birth places [ ] Twenty-one states claim the distinction of being the birthplace of a president. One president's birth state is in dispute; North and South Carolina (British colonies at the time) both lay claim to Andrew Jackson, who was born in 1767, in the Waxhaw region along their common border. Jackson himself considered South Carolina as his birth state. Born on December 5, 1782, Martin Van Buren was the first president born an American citizen (and not a British subject). The term Virginia dynasty is sometimes used to describe the fact that four of the first five U.S. presidents were from Virginia.

Girls Who Code report assesses gender gap The percentage of women and nonbinary people entering tech has dropped over the last 40 years, but the organization’s CEO still has reasons to hope. In this Oct. 30, 2015, photo, Emily Hennessy, senior computer science major at Florida State University Panama City, helps students create video games during a \\\"Girls Who Code\\\" class in Panama City, Florida. (Heather Leiphart/News Herald/AP) Nadra Nittle Education reporter Published 2022-11-15 05:00 5:00 November 15, 2022 am Republish this story Share Bluesky Facebook Email Republish this story November marks exactly a decade since Girls Who Code started with a mission of closing the gender gap in the tech industry. Since its 2012 launch, the organization has served 500,000 girls, women and nonbinary young people globally — half of whom come from Black, Latinx,  low-income or other underrepresented groups — via clubs, summer programs and college and career programs in which they meet tech leaders, explore coding and build professional skills. But the percentage of these individuals entering into the technology profession has dropped steadily over the past several decades. Girls Who Code and the software manufacturer Logitech set out to discover why, issuing a report to identify “What (and Who) Is Holding Women Back in Tech?” “The problem often is that bias can be both conscious and unconscious,” said Delphine Donné, general manager of personal workspace solutions at Logitech. “Whether it is a parent, a teacher, a coworker or a leader, we need to help them become aware and overcome their unconscious bias, for example, through training. This is important for both men and women.” The 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one . The “What Is Holding Women Back?” report, based on a survey of 400 early-career tech and IT workers, found that the perception persists that these careers are for men, noting that only one in five people who earned computer science degrees in 2019 were women. Moreover, 63 percent of women surveyed said their college classes were gender imbalanced. In the workplace, 90 percent of women report experiencing microaggressions, or subtle forms of discrimination. Sixty-six percent report that they have been treated differently from men in their workplace, and 62 percent said their ideas have been dismissed and they have been viewed as less capable than men. Half of the women surveyed have endured incivility, disrespect, contempt and sexist jokes, and 40 percent have survived sexual harassment. “That nine in ten women have experienced microaggressions at work … is unacceptable and must stop,” Donné said. “It is more important than ever that we make inclusivity pervasive. We need to foster a more inclusive and collaborative environment that encourages and enables everyone to be seen and heard, and empowered to speak up, openly or confidentiality — in school, at university, at work, everywhere.” While the study identified the challenges women pursuing tech careers face, it also highlighted the actions that can make a positive difference.

Actually, it was more about what she didn't see. \\\"I would go into [a] computer science classroom, and literally just see, like, lines and lines and lines of boys trying to be the next Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg,\\\" she says. \\\"I was just like: Where are the girls?\\\" VIDEO 4:20 04:20 Meet the teen volunteer teaching coding classes Homegrown Heroes Part of the issue, Saujani says, is that girls can get dissuaded from STEM education topics at a young age. Despite being the daughter of two engineers, \\\"I got it in my head [early on] that I wasn't good at it,\\\" she says. \\\"I think that's what happens with a lot of girls.\\\" Dr. Tarika Barrett, who took over as Girls Who Code's CEO in April 2021 , says another problem is that high-profile tech role models are often male. \\\"Our data tells us: Before girls are even 10 years old, they've already internalized so many of these cultural touchstones about what a computer scientist looks like,\\\" she says. \\\"It resonates with them throughout their entire lives.\\\" Those data points are core to Girls Who Code's mission: Funneling more women into an industry where entry-level employees can land annual salaries over $150,000 at companies like Google and Facebook, Saujani says, could be \\\"this great equalizer, in terms of poverty alleviation ... you could literally have millions of girls march into the middle class.\\\" Changing the culture Step one: Encourage a cultural sea change in STEM education. Barrett says she's proud of Girls Who Code's various awareness campaigns, from a book series for young readers to a joint 2020 Super Bowl commercial with skincare brand Olay, featuring stars Lily Singh and Busy Phillips as astronauts. Girls Who Code has even made music videos with rappers like Lizzo and Doja Cat . \\\"These campaigns aren't just entertainment,\\\" Barrett says. \\\"Every time a girl, and especially a Black or brown girl, sees themselves reflected in something like this, it can be game-changing.\\\" The change in perspective is palpable, Saujani says. A decade ago, she often heard from parents who struggled to get their daughters interested in coding, saying: \\\"It's just not cool.\\\" Now, she says, she's \\\"inundated with people like, 'Will you take a picture with me? My daughter is the captain of her robotics team!' We did change [the] culture, and we made coding cool.\\\" Girls Who Code CEO Dr. Tarika Barrett with a group of young coders. Source: Girls Who Code The second step, both Saujani and Barrett say, is much harder for Girls Who Code to impact — because it revolves around the culture at many U.S. tech companies. \\\"Half of women leave tech roles by the age of 35, with many of them saying that their workplaces were still inhospitable to women,\\\" Barrett says, citing the study from Girls Who Code and Accenture. Harassment often creates toxic work cultures: In 2020, nonprofit Women Who Tech found that more than 40% of female tech employees said they'd been sexually harassed by a superior. Women now make up just 26% of the workforce in computer science-related jobs – with Black and Latinx women making up only about 5% , collectively – according to a study from the National Center for Women & Information Technology. More than half of Girls Who Code alumni come from historically underrepresented racial or socioeconomic groups, the organization says — but that focus has yet to result in significant industry change. \\\"And we still have half of women in tech saying that they lack female role models,\\\" Barrett says. The next 10 years Barrett and Saujani say they're realistic about the limits of their work, and just how much needs to happen before gender equity in the computer science field is a realistic possibility. Both suggest Girls Who Code could better leverage its partnerships with tech giants — like Twitter and Facebook, for example — to help make their environments better for female employees. \\\"Our research also found that more inclusive work cultures could actually increase the number of women in tech by three million,\\\" Barrett says. \\\"So much of this is really encouraging companies to look deeply at their own practices.\\\" With that in mind, Barrett says, Girls Who Code has a new goal : Achieve gender parity in new, entry-level tech jobs by 2030. Once you get girls interested in computer science, you need to make sure they can actually go on to land careers in tech as young women, she says. To that end, Girls Who Code has rolled out a workforce development program aimed at matching its college-aged alumni with potential tech jobs and female tech mentors. Last year, the nonprofit also partnered with the Biden Administra\"\n}\n**Web Page 4:**\n{\n  \"id\": 4,\n  \"title\": \"2019 Annual Report - Girls Who Code\",\n  \"url\": \"https://girlswhocode.com/2019report/\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"In the last year, the number of Girls Who Code college-aged alumni grew from 30,000 to 80,000. · 80,000 Girls Who Code college-aged alumni Female CS graduates, ...\",\n  \"context\": \"ter, Girls Who Code has 8,500 Clubs operating across the country and around the world. Weâve raised $100 million to close the gender gap in tech from partners and allies who are deeply committed to diversifying their workforces. And weâve reached 500 million people with our campaigns, changing peopleâs perceptions about computer science. In under a decade, Girls Who Code has solved the so-called âpipeline problemâ and completely shifted the gender gap in K–12 computer science classrooms. Weâve reached so many girls that the graduating classes of top computer science colleges are closer to parity than theyâve been since the 1980s. And in the next seven years, weâll have closed the gender gap in new entry-level tech jobs. This movement we started in a small, borrowed conference room in New York is well on its way to completely and totally transforming the industry. And weâre able to do all of this because we believe deeply that this work is as much about coding as it is about equity and diversity and opportunity. Because we envision a world where girls have access to the highest-paying jobs in the market. Where they canât imagine a workplace where their peers, mentors, bosses arenât women who look like them. Where women thriving in tech is the norm, not the exception. That world is within reach.

OUR ALUMNI In the last year, the number of Girls Who Code college-aged alumni grew from 30,000 to 80,000. To put that in perspective, American universities graduate just 12,500 female computer science (CS) majors every year. We now have more than six times that number of alumni who are college-aged. 80,000 Girls Who Code college-aged alumni Female CS graduates, 2017-18 12,500 Our college-aged alumni are majoring in computer science and related fields at 15 times the national average.

It was my first academic setting that wasnât discipline-oriented, but success-oriented. I was used to teachers talking down to you. Girls Who Code showed me what the classroom and education could be like. CULTURE CHANGE WORK Weâve never underestimated the power of culture, how stereotypes impact girls and young women. And thatâs why weâve been able to move the needle on this issue. Because weâre willing to work to change culture and combat stereotypes. âBRAVE, NOT PERFECTâ In 2019, Girls Who Code founder and CEO Reshma Saujani released her international bestseller âBrave, Not Perfectâ and re-launched a podcast by the same title. She has sparked a national conversation about how girls are raised to be perfect and how we all can break free from the cult of perfection. DAY OF THE GIRL / SISTERHOOD This year, for the organizationâs annual Sisterhood campaign, Girls Who Code launched the first-ever all-digital global march for girls, by girls, and about girls: the #MarchForSisterhood. Over 250,000 girls from around the world participated in the march and hundreds of millions viewed the campaign. Today, girlsâand all who identify as girlsâare more connected to one another than ever before. Our ideas and dreams spread quickly from one smartphone to another, allowing us to share our lives with another girl, family, and community a world away. BRINGING COMPUTER SCIENCE TO K–12 CLASSROOMS Girls Who Code is passing the first gender-focused computer science legislation at the state and federal level, with bills passed in Washington and Colorado in 2019. As a part of that work, Girls Who Code convened a bipartisan panel with female congressional leadership to discuss policy solutions to bring more girls into computer science. Girls Who Code Event with Congressional Leadership, July 2019. From left to right, Rep. Ayanna Pressley, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, Sen.

Girls Who Code was founded in 2010 and is a national movement with the mission of closing the gender gap in technology through after-school clubs, summer courses and summer immersion programs. These programs are offered to girls of all ages and focus on developing computer science and coding skills. “Women and girls across the country are coming together to correct centuries-long power imbalances across lines of gender, race, sexuality, and more,” said Founder and CEO Reshma Saujani on the organization’s website. “Girls Who Code is proud to be a part of this movement, and even prouder because our girls – girls of all races and ethnicities and abilities and zip codes – are leading it.” According to the organization’s website, in 1995, 37 percent of computer scientists were women. Today, it’s only 24 percent. In approximately 10 years, the number of women in computing will decrease to just 22 percent. Former Otterbein University President Kathy Krendl, Executive Director to the Point Erin Bender, and junior computer science major Lexi McQueen noticed this increasing problem and worked together to start a Girls Who Code club on Otterbein’s campus in 2017. McQueen and Celina Hu, administrative assistant to The Point and the Engineering Department are currently leading the second session of Otterbein’s Girls Who Code club, which is held on Wednesday evenings from 6-8 p.m. at The Point. This semester, girls in the club are learning about virtual reality game development and research. “When we first started this program last year, there were approximately six girls who consistently came each week,” said Hu. “This year, that number grew to about 20 girls.” Otterbein’s Girls Who Code club has reached girls from nearly all surrounding school districts, including Columbus, Olentangy, South-Western, Westerville, Grandview Heights, Worthington and Dublin. A group of software development professionals from JPMorgan Chase also help facilitate the weekly club meetings by volunteering their time to come speak to the girls about their careers and assist in project development. McQueen said she is happy to be in a position where she can set a positive example for other girls interested in computer science and believes Otterbein is the right place to do it. “If anything is going to start with women and innovation, it’s going to start here,” said McQueen. “This is one of the most forward-thinking places and an environment I’m proud to be a part of.” Girls Who Code has reached over 90,000 girls and young women throughout all 50 U.S. states through their outreach programs.

The largest drop in enrollment in CS programs occurs between the ages of 13 and 17, which is why Girls Who Code targets young women in that age gap. Nationwide, they host after school clubs for girls from 3rd to 5th grade and 6th to 12th grade girls to explore coding in a fun and friendly environment. They also hold 2-week specialized courses for 6th-12th grade girls on a range of computer science topics. Their 7-week summer programs are specifically designed for High School Sophomore and Juniors to learn the skills required for coding and gain exposure to jobs in the technology industry. When a girl becomes an Alumni of Girls Who Code programs, their network doesn’t end there. In addition to their 3rd-12th grade programs, Girls Who Code has a program in place to help guide their alumni to success in college by building community with other women in technology on their campuses. Nationally amongst computer science enrollment, almost 38 percent of all students K-12 are female. When you look at the statistics for students from underrepresented populations such as black, Latina and students from low-income households, the number drops to 15 percent. Girls Who Code is on a mission to make those numbers of women in computer science proportional to the general population. That’s why their programs have served 185,000 girls to date and indirectly served over 100,000,000 women. The power of diversity in technology creates innovation and opportunity for everyone, not just girls. A diverse perspective and maximum advancement in the technology field is best achieved by closing the gender gap. Alumni of Girls Who Code whom have already declared their majors are choosing to specialize in CS related fields at a rate 15 times the national average. Founder, Reshma Saujani, started her career as an attorney and activist and surged into the political spotlight when she became the first Indian American woman to run for US Congress. That’s why it’s no surprise that Girls Who Code has been working to draft what she called the “first-ever federal Girls Who Code legislation to encourage states to start reporting on their gender diversity data.” In order to improve the demographic of the CS field, we have to start tracking and reporting the statistics. There’s no way to change something you haven’t measured. So far this year, two states in the US have passed laws that track gender diversity in the industry - Washington and Colorado. However, Girls Who Code’s initiative is the first to mention legislation at the federal level. A federal law mandating schools to track and report the demographics of their CS classes is critical to the impact of girls’ participation in CS programs. The current efforts to expand CS education is simply not enough. In addition to these efforts, Girls Who Code recommends that state legislatures expand computer science education to all middle schools and introduce policies that fund gender inclusion training for teachers. These efforts will increase girls’ exposure to women in technology whom they can identify with and look up to. The gender and race of an inventor plays a significant role in determining a child’s career path. One study, by Stanford professor Raj Chetty, states that if girls were exposed to female inventors as often as boys are to male inventors, the gender gap in innovation would be half what it currently is. Next Level Solutions Developer, Brittany Wilkes saw this as the perfect opportunity to give back to an industry that has given so much to her. We are proud to support her as she teaches the Girls Who Code after school club for 7th and 8th graders in Chapin, South Carolina. She will be facilitating the club with Lori Powers, Digital Integration Specialist of Chapin Middle School. Brittany’s daughters are the reason she initially got involved, but her motivation for the program to succeed stems deeper than that. “It’s so important to get girls involved in technology before they feel unwelcome.

Among its programs are a summer immersion program, a specialized campus program, after-school clubs, a college club, College Loops, [ 1 ] [ 2 ] and a series of books. [ 3 ] The organization is based in New York and has programs in all of the United States, [ 4 ] Canada, [ 5 ] India, [ 6 ] and the United Kingdom. [ 7 ] As of 2022, there were more than 500,000 Girls Who Code alums. [ 8 ] History [ edit ] Reshma Saujani, Girls Who Code founder Girls Who Code was founded by Reshma Saujani in 2012 who came up with the idea of creating the organization during her run for the United States Congress . Reshma's inspiration stemmed from finding that schools along her campaign route lacked female representation in computer science classrooms. [ 9 ] The organization began under the White House Science & Technology Initiative. [ 10 ] The second hire and founding curriculum director was Ashley Gavin before her career as a comedian. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Girls Who Code runs programs during the academic year teaching high school girls computing skills such as programming , robotics , and web design , [ 13 ] [ 14 ] with sessions including projects and trips to companies such as Twitter and Facebook . [ 9 ] [ 15 ] As of 2014, there were more than 1,500 Girls Who Code clubs across America. [ 14 ] By December 2014, three thousand students had completed a Girls Who Code program, 95% of whom stated they desired to major in computer science in higher education. [ 16 ] According to the organization's 2022 report, there are approximately 185,000 college or post-college age alumni who have completed the program. [ 17 ] In 2019, the organization announced plans to expand to 10,000 clubs in all 50 states. [ 18 ] In 2020, Girls Who Code launched a free 2-week virtual Summer Immersion Program in response to the COVID-19 pandemic , with the program serving 5,000 girls in its first year. [ 19 ] [ 20 ] The organization is sponsored by several software and technology companies, including AOL , Google , and Microsoft , [ 15 ] [ 21 ] and in August 2014 received a $1 million contribution from AT&T . [ 22 ] Expansion in USA [ edit ] Girls Who Code announced that in 2016 the nonprofit organization would be expanding to all 50 states. In August 2017, they launched a successful series of 13 books, including a nonfiction book, Girls Who Code: Learn to Code and Change the World , and several fiction books. [ 23 ] By the spring of 2018, Girls Who Code reached more than 50,000 girls with their computer science education programs. [ 24 ] As of February 2021, Girls Who Code had more than 80,000 college-aged alums who are entering the workforce. [ 25 ] As of March 2021, Girls Who Code clubs and programs had reached more than 300,000 girls globally. [ 26 ] The organization's efforts to close the achievement gender gap have resulted in several honors. Saujani was recognized for her vision and efforts to close the gender gap in technology. [ 27 ] Girls Who Code alumni include Andrea Gonzales and Sophie Houser, the creators of the video game Tampon Run . [ 28 ] In 2020, Girls Who Code updated its brand design in order to connect better with Generation Z . The new design is called \\\"making waves\\\" because it is based on the shape of formatted code. The indentations used for formatting code create a wave shape. This new brand update involved many different types of waves, a new color palette, a font change, and a single-color logo. [ 29 ] Programs [ edit ] Clubs [ edit ] The Girls Who Code after-school club program is open to middle and high school girls between 13 and 18. [ 5 ] These clubs are run by college students, teachers, librarians, or professionals in the technology industry. Club meeting times vary among clubs, but are approximately 20 weeks with 2 hour meetings per week. The club curriculum is built on four foundational computer science concepts: loops, conditionals, variables, and functions. The organization calls these the \\\"core-four.\\\" Club activities consist of coding tutorials, pre-professional workshops, and community building events. [ 4 ] Summer Immersion Program [ edit ] The Summer Immersion Program (SIP) was a seven-week in-person summer camp program offered for girls in tenth and eleventh grade to introduce them to the world of coding. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the program developed into a two-week virtual program. [ 30 ] These summer camps are based at more than 80 technology companies across the United States, including Facebook , Twitter , Adobe , Prudential , Microsoft , and Sephora . [ 31 ] The company at which the SIP is based also offers a mentorship program that matches girls in the camp with women in the company. The core curriculum for the program includes lessons on HTML , CSS , and JavaScript programming languages with extra material varying between program sites. The program ends with a final group project, project showcase, and graduation ceremony. [ 32 ] Partnerships [ edit ] In 2016, Girls Who Code partnered with Accenture [ 33 ] and subsequently, released a report on recommendations to decrease the gender gap in computing. [ 34 ] Dell Technologies [ 35 ] has partnered with the organization to support after school programs for young girls.

Women remain underrepresented in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, making up only 27% of today’s STEM workforce . Although women’s participation in STEM fields has increased during the last 30 years, women remain underrepresented in the computer science (CS) field and their participation has declined from 37% in 1995 to 22% in 2022 . Thus, it is crucial to change women’s perception of CS by providing trainings that pique their interest in learning CS and preparing them with the necessary skills to pursue CS-related postsecondary education and careers. In an effort to address gender disparities in the computer science field and promote diversity in the CS pipeline, Girls Who Code offers two free virtual summer programs , the Summer Immersion Program (SIP) and the Self-Paced Program (SPP), specifically designed for female and nonbinary high school students. The summer programs aim to elevate students’ proficiency and enthusiasm in computer science and encourage pursuit of related higher education and careers. AIR partnered with Girls Who Code to conduct an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of its summer virtual programs. The goal of this study is answer these questions: What are the effects of participation in the Girls Who Code’s SIP and SPP programs on majoring in a CS-related field during postsecondary education? How do those effects vary by different student groups? Impact Evaluation Findings AIR conducted a quasi-experimental study comparing SIP and SPP participants to similar waitlisted students to determine the effects of program participation on majoring in a CS-related field. This study utilized publicly available National Student Clearinghouse data and Girls Who Code records from program participants and program waitlist students for the years 2020-22. The study yielded two key findings. First, on average, both SIP and SPP participants were significantly more likely to major in a CS-related field (by 13.2 percentage points and 11.5 percentage points, respectively) than comparison students. Second, both SIP and SPP consistently demonstrated positive effects on majoring in a CS-related field across most of the student groups examined, including White, Black/African American, and Hispanic or Latino/a students; students who are historically underrepresented in computing; and students with little to no prior CS knowledge. This study comes with several limitations that warrant consideration when interpreting findings. First, estimated program effects may be influenced by a few preexisting student characteristics (e.g., GPA and motivation) that we were not able to access and control for in the analyses. Second, certain student groups had small sample sizes, resulting in low statistical power for analyzing variations in program effects. Girls Who Code Summer Programs Summer Immersion Program (SIP) . Starting in 2020, Girls Who Code introduced the virtual SIP, a two-week synchronous live program, a response to the COVID-19 pandemic that served as a replacement for the in-person SIP that Girls Who Code originally offered. Throughout the program, participants are introduced to key CS concepts and guided through step-by-step tutorials to complete real-world projects. Participants also have the chance to engage in a mentorship workshop and gain insights into career oppo\"\n}\n**Web Page 9:**\n{\n  \"id\": 9,\n  \"title\": \"Women in tech interview: Girls Who Code CEO Tarika Barrett\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2023/10/more-women-hired-tech-sector-girls-who-code/\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"“Women make up only 26% of all computing roles, and for Black and Latinx women, the statistics are even worse – combined, they make up roughly ...\",\n  \"context\": \"HTTP error occurred: 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.weforum.org/stories/2023/10/more-women-hired-tech-sector-girls-who-code/\"\n}\n**Web Page 10:**\n{\n  \"id\": 10,\n  \"title\": \"Changing the Curve: Women in Computing - I School Online\",\n  \"url\": \"https://ischoolonline.berkeley.edu/blog/women-computing-computer-science/\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"In 2020, females were 47 percent of AP Calculus test-takers and 31 percent of AP Computer Science test-takers.

According to The New York Times , women were the predominant software engineers of the 1940s: “At the time, men in the computing industry regarded writing code as a secondary, less interesting task.” But as the industry became more desirable for men, women became a shrinking minority. Women comprised 37 percent of all students graduating with degrees in computer and information sciences in 1984. By 2010, they accounted for less than half that. datascience@berkeley explores the history and influence of women in computing and reviews the state of the gap between women and men in computing today. Timeline of Women’s Achievements in Computing and Computer Science 1843 ADA LOVELACE expands on Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine. She is widely considered the first computer programmer. 1946 ENIAC PROGRAMMERS program the first all-electronic, programmable computer for the U.S. army. The six women were not credited for their work. 1952 GRACE HOPPER invents the first computer compiler. 1962 KATHERINE JOHNSON performs the orbital calculations needed for John Glenn’s orbital space mission. 1965 SISTER MARY KENNETH KELLER is the first woman to earn a Ph.D. in computer science in the United States. 1978 CAROL SHAW becomes the first professional female video game designer. 1985 RADIA PERLMAN invents the Spanning Tree Protocol. She is referred to as the “Mother of the Internet.” 1997 ANITA BORG founds the Institute for Women in Technology. 2005 RUCHI SANGHVI is hired as the first female engineer at Facebook. 2018 JOY BUOLAMWINI authors research uncovering large racial and gender bias in AI services. She is the founder of the Algorithmic Justice League. Women and Computing Education The computing field, and women’s involvement in it, predates traditional computer science education. The first department began at Purdue University in the 1960s, almost 100 years after Ada Lovelace wrote the first computer program. Today, degree programs are prolific. But the data about the students involved with them reveals large gender gaps at all levels of schooling. For example, the Advanced Placement (AP) Exam — a standardized test for high-achieving high school students in the subject of their choosing — has been administered to more female than male students since the year 2000. However, girls make up slightly less than half of all calculus test-takers in the program. An even wider gap exists among computer science students: Despite the doubling of the proportion of test-takers who are female in the past 20 years, College Board data indicates they are still less than one-third. In 2000, females were about 54 percent of all Advanced Placement exam test-takers. That same year, they were 45 percent of AP Calculus test-takers and 15 percent of AP Computer Science test-takers. Since then, the percentage of all test-takers who are female has risen to almost 56 percent. In 2020, females were 47 percent of AP Calculus test-takers and 31 percent of AP Computer Science test-takers. As students rise through the education system, gender gaps in computing persist. Women make up more of the overall population of bachelor’s degree recipients—57 percent in 2019, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. However, as with AP exams, women are disproportionately underrepresented in the computing field. The same data reveals that in 1986, women comprised about 36 percent of computer and information science bachelor’s degree recipients, but that number fell to less than half by 2010. Most recent data shows that women receive about one in five of conferred computing bachelor’s degrees . In 1971, only 14 percent of computer science bachelor’s degree recipients were women. The proportion of women receiving these degrees peaked during the mid-1980s — in 1986, 36 percent of all recipients were women. Since then, the number has declined. As of 2019, 21 percent of computer science bachelor’s degree recipients were women. Women and the Computing Workforce The decline of girls entering computer science programs trickled down to the workforce quickly. In 1991, women held about 36 percent of computing occupations, according to the National Center for Women and Information Technology. By 2014, they were only about one-fourth of computing professionals. Overall, the proportion of women in computer and mathematical occupations has declined 19 percent since 1995 , according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Today, women’s participation in computing occupations varies by position. In 2020, women comprised 36 percent of computer systems analysts, 12 percent of information security analysts, 21 percent of computer programmers, 19 percent of software developers, 28 percent of web developers and 29 percent of database administrators and architects. The employment gender gap is larger for women of color. In 2020, the computing workforce was 3 percent Black women, 2 percent Hispanic women and 7 percent Asian women, according to WIT by the Numbers 2021 . Why are girls and women not pursuing computing as often as their male counterparts? Research does not have a conclusive answer, but survey data points to some of the differences in how men and women value their careers. For example, women were significantly more likely than men to cite, “I am interested in helping people or society” as a reason for pursuing a computing degree, according to a Girls in IT report from Microsoft. But even this preference cannot stand on its own. The Microsoft report states that “girls do not come by these perceptions, interests, and career decisions innately or in a vacuum. Indeed, these are shaped by the larger society and local environments in which they learn about computing and technology.” The report shows that abstract curriculum fails to connect the social influence of computing to the profession; a tendency toward independent, non-collaborative learning; and unconscious biases about “innate” talent all contribute to an industry that syst\"\n}\n"

Key sources for these figures include Girls Who Code’s 2019 Annual Report and their cited data on organizational websites, as well as reports from partner organizations like the National Center for Women & Information Technology. The decline is attributed to factors like biased perceptions, workplace microaggressions, and a lack of inclusive environments in tech."

      "\n\n<|begin_search_result|>From the provided web pages, the most relevant information pertains to **Papa Felipe's Mexican Restaurant** in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The restaurant was highlighted in the Sterns' *Roadfood* guide (a resource often referenced by culinary experts) for its unique **green chile carne adovada**, a variation of a traditional New Mexican dish. While the search query specifies \"green chile stew,\" Papa Felipe's is noted for its innovative use of green chile in dishes like their \"green tamale pie\" and green chile marinade for carne adovada.  A key detail is that the Sterns' *Roadfood* book series is mentioned as a trusted source for regional American cuisine, which may align with the search for a **book recommended by James Beard Award winners**. However, none of the pages explicitly mention **Ali's Kitchen** or a direct James Beard Award win for the restaurant in 2015. The closest match is **Fry Bread House** in Arizona (mentioned in Web Page 7), which won a James Beard Award (America's Classics category) but is not in New Mexico.  **Conclusion:**  While no direct reference to \"Ali's Kitchen\" or a 2015 James Beard Award for a New Mexican restaurant with green chile stew was found, **Papa Felipe's** emerges as a prominent New Mexican restaurant highlighted in culinary guides for its green chile-infused dishes. The *Roadfood* book by the Sterns is a likely candidate for the recommended source.<|end_search_result|>\n\n"

Tis the season…for year-end retrospectives in which the good, the bad and the ugly; the triumphs and tragedies; the highs and lows and the ups and downs are revisited ad-infinitum by seemingly every print and cyberspace medium in existence. It’s the time of year in which the “in-your-face” media practically forces a reminiscence–either fondly or with disgust–about the year that was. It’s a time for introspection, resolutions and for looking forward with hope to the year to come. The New Mexico culinary landscape had more highs than it did lows in 2015. Here’s my thrilling (and filling) recap. Hardly a week passed during 2016 in which the world didn’t lose one or more of the biggest names in music, acting, literature and politics. We celebrate their lives and mourn their passing. While perhaps not as tragic, 2016 also saw the closure of several beloved restaurants. Some flashed early potential only to fade quickly. Others stood the test of time. Still others closed only to reinvent themselves with new concepts and menus. One saving grace was the launch of several new independent restaurants which are quickly becoming favorites. Your host for three Friends of Gil dinners in 2016 2015 was another banner year for Gil’s Thrilling (and Filling) Blog. There are now more than 8,200 reader comments on 956 reviews, an increase of more than 800 comments and 55 new reviews. I value your comments immensely and appreciate that you thought enough of my blog this year to have voted me, for the fifth time in six years, as one of the city’s five best bloggers in Albuquerque The Magazine ’s annual “best of the city” issue. Contrary to my friend Schuyler’s contention, the Russians didn’t rig the balloting nor did I ever promise to leave the country if I didn’t win. From among the 955 reviews published on Gil’s Thrilling…here are the most popular during 2016: (1) Laguna Burger in Albuquerque; (2) The Owl Cafe & Bar in San Antonio; (3) Mary and Tito’s Cafe in Albuquerque; (4) Eli’s Place (Formerly Sophia’s Place) in Albuquerque; (5) Philly’s N Fries in Albuquerque; (6) Red Rock Deli in Albuquerque; (7) K&I Diner in Albuquerque; (8) The Frontier Restaurant in Albuquerque; (9) Bocadillo’s in Albuquerque; and (10) Eclectic Urban Pizzeria and Tap House . Thank you, New Mexico and beyond, for your contributions to Gil’s Thrilling (And Filling) Blog. I’ve always bragged about having the most discerning, intelligent and passionate readers of any online presence in the blogosphere. Caldo de Rez from La Nueva Casita in Las Cruces.

December, 2016 Whatever your idealogical bent may be, many of us agreed with conservative talking-head Glenn Beck when he said “ whoever thought a tiny candy bar should be called fun size was a moron .” There are, of course, exceptions to this. Chocolatiers throughout the fruited plain have proven time after time that even bite-size chocolates can be absolutely delicious. Take, for example, the delicious creations crafted by the Chocolate Lady in historic Old Mesilla’s plaza who creates premier chocolates in the tradition of European candy makers. Her chocolates are so good they’ve captured the notice of MSN Lifestyle which singled the Chocolate Lady in its “ Candy Store That Everyone Is Talking About in Your State ” feature. While many of us look to traditional tried-and-true family recipes to sate hungry guests who dine with us over the holidays, others scour online resources for something new and different. So what recipes do New Mexicans search for? According to the Thrillist feature, the most searched for holiday recipes in all fifty states , we Google fudge more than any other holiday recipe. Perhaps if we were in closer proximity to the San Antonio General Store , we wouldn’t need to search online for fudge recipes. Vanilla Custard with toppings from Caliche’s in Las Cruces. Photo Courtesy of Melodie K . According to Travel & Leisure, “ Albuquerque has always played second fiddle to Santa Fe when it comes to tourism. But now, the vibrant New Mexican city is experiencing a renaissance, thanks to its restaurateurs’ dedication to using healthy, locally sourced food in creative ways .” The Five Restaurants Leading Albuquerque’s Local Food Renaissance are El Pinto whose vegetable garden “gives a new meaning to “local food;” the Golden Crown Panaderia whose “hand-mixed, chemical-free, complex-carbohydrate flours have earned the bakery a serious cult following;” La Merienda at Los Poblanos which claims to have “the most pure field-to-fork menu;” Standard Diner whose menu showcases some local produce, natural meats, and some creative vegetarian alternatives; and the Pueblo Harvest Cafe which uses ingredients from its on-site garden (that uses traditional farming techniques against the backdrop of the Sandia Mountains) and an horno (a traditional beehive-shaped outdoor mud oven) to bake fresh breads daily. In listing the “ Sports Bar in Your State Everyone is Talking About ,” Delish spilled “ on where sports fans flock for great atmosphere, cold beer and some seriously good grub .” It stands to reason that the Del Charro Saloon , a sports bar affectionately called “Santa Fe’s watering hole” would be t\"\n}\n**Web Page 2:**\n{\n  \"id\": 2,\n  \"title\": \"Papa Felipe's Mexican Restaurant - Albuquerque, New Mexico\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.nmgastronome.com/?p=4572\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Papa Felipe's uses a blend of chopped green chile from Bueno Foods (a New Mexico institution since 1946) as well as the fat, elongated chiles ...\",\n  \"context\": \"ht of the ubiquitous national food chain, Stern was optimistic that “Americans have become more conscious about regional food,” which in his experience was once thought to be limited to fried chicken and hot dogs. He praised the “ rebirth of interest in regional food that parallels its diminution because of franchises .” New Mexicans should be duly proud at how well represented our cuisine is among the 500 uniquely American foods celebrated in the book. By the same token, as I’ve often railed about on this blog, if we don’t patronize the mom and pop restaurants who prepare these authentic time-tested treasures, all we will be left with is the chain restaurants and their homogeneous cardboard tasting food, superficial flamboyance and saccharin service. Chips and Salsa Unlike on their previous Roadfood books, the Sterns actually rank what they consider the “ best of the best ” among the foods described. Understandably, when a book is published which encompasses the length and breadth of the United States, omissions are bound to occur. Still, for the most part, the Sterns do a wonderful job of winnowing out the premium wheat from a prize crop, highlighting those restaurants which provide unforgettable dining experiences in their natural setting prepared by locals who still do it in the traditional ways. In the Sterns’ estimation, the “ hot list ” of New Mexican restaurants proffering the very best carne adovada in America starts with Rancho de Chimayo, whose carne adovada is described as “ chunks of meat turned tender from their long marinade and glistening fiery red .” Following in succession are the Horseman’s Haven Cafe in Santa Fe, Albuquerque’s Frontier Restaurant , Leona’s Restaurant in Chimayo, then two Duke City dining institutions Sadie’s of New Mexico and Papa Felipe’s. Botana Crispeana Most New Mexicans would probably agree with at least one restaurant named in that hallowed list. My own “hot list,” for example, would rank Mary & Tito’s Cafe as the standard-bearer, but would also include the carne adovada at Cecilia’s Cafe , The Burrito Lady and Duran’s Central Pharmacy in Albuquerque as well as The Shed in Santa Fe and the aforementioned Rancho de Chimayo. Dissenting voices tell me one restaurant that belongs on my hot list is Papa Felipe’s.  This Albuquerque institution did make the Sterns listing.  The dynamic duo of dining observed tht  “ an unusual version is served at Papa Felipe’s Mexican Restaurant…where the pork is sopped with a marinade of green chiles, giving it a unique vegetable potency. It’s great as a green tamale pie, baked in sweet corn masa and laced with cheese .” Caldo de Albondigas Green chile carne adovada is indeed a unique spin on a New Mexico standard, and to the best of my knowledge, Papa Felipe’s is the only restaurant in Albuquerque, if not the entire state, to feature it. When you stop to think about it, why not green chile carne adovada. The preparation process is the same–marinating chunks of pork in chile. Papa Felipe’s uses a blend of chopped green chile from Bueno Foods (a New Mexico institution since 1946) as well as the fat, elongated chiles they use for chile rellenos. The marinading process takes about three hours. The results will impress themselves on your taste buds for much longer. Papa Felipe’s Mexican Restaurant & Lounge has been pleasing Albuquerque palates for more than 45 years with chef Larry Gonzales at the helm for much of that time (1983-2021). As with several restaurants in the Land of Enchantment, it straddles the sometimes ambiguous demarcation between New Mexican food and Mexican food and in fact, serves cuisine unique to and shared by both (often the sole distinction being the degree of heat). Some of the very best items on the menu are those with which Chef Gonzales took liberties and those he essentially invented.  On 28 July 2023, the larger-than-life  chef and general manager of Papa Felipe’s in Albuquerque passed away.  Larry was renowned almost as much for his sense of humor and customer orientation as he was for the New Mexican cuisine he prepared for nearly four decades. Green Tamale Pie, a Papa Felipe’s Exclusive For many Albuquerque diners, Papa Felipe’s hasn’t been the same since Larry’s retirement in 2021.  That’s an opinion I’ve heard several times.  While Larry’s outgoing nature and personality will always permeate the restaurant he loved and to which he gave so much of his life, servers have told us nothing has changed.  Larry’s recipes are still in use.  I’ve always maintained that the mark of an outstanding restaurant is consistency.  We don’t visit Papa Felipe’s frequent enough to determine how consistent it is.  Our visits have usually met with good meals, enthusiastic service and plenty of doggie bags.   Papa Felipe’s is now owned by Albuquerque restaurateur Rudy Guerrero. From an experiential perspective, Papa Felipe’s has the look and feel of a Mexican restaurant that belies the New Mexico style stucco exterior. The interior features a combination of whitewash and stucco colored walls with faux adobe half-walls separating the main dining room. A mural of what appears to be a Mexican village is painted on one wall. A surprisingly good house stereo system pipes in Mexican standards by the great crooners of yesteryear and today. Seating is comfortable and plush.  A full bar serves a wide variety of domestic and Mexican beers and a selection of house wines as well as what is reputed to be “the meanest margarita in town.” One of the more popular margaritas is named for New Mexico’s legendary Dixon apple. Additionally, Papa Felipe’s offers full-service catering, drop-off catering and pick-up services. Big Papa Breakfast Burrito The wait staff is prompt with complementary chips and salsa . The chips are lightly salted and thin. The salsa, which is sold online internationally, is also lightly salted. It is a jalapeno-based salsa which according to the Web site is made from “ the finest ingredients combined with secret spices. ” It’s not an especially piquant salsa and has a pureed texture like a tomato pa\"\n}\n**Web Page 3:**\n{\n  \"id\": 3,\n  \"title\": \"James Beard Foundation Award: 2020s - Wikipedia\",\n  \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Beard_Foundation_Award:_2020s\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"The James Beard Foundation Awards are annual awards presented by the James Beard Foundation to recognize culinary professionals in the United States.\",\n  \"context\": \"James Beard Foundation Award: 2020s - Wikipedia Jump to content Main menu Main menu move to sidebar hide Navigation Main page Contents Current events Random article About Wikipedia Contact us Contribute Help Learn to edit Community portal Recent changes Upload file Special pages Search Search Appearance Donate Create account Log in Personal tools Donate Create account Log in Pages for logged out editors learn more Contributions Talk Contents move to sidebar hide (Top) 1 2020 awards Toggle 2020 awards subsection 1.1 Lifetime Achievement and Humanitarian Award 1.2 Restaurant Design Awards 1.3 Book Awards 1.4 Broadcast Media Awards 1.5 Journalism Awards 2 2021 awards 3 2022 awards Toggle 2022 awards subsection 3.1 Lifetime Achievement and Humanitarian Award 3.2 Leadership Award 3.3 Restaurant and Chef Awards 3.4 Book Awards 3.5 Broadcast Media Awards 3.6 Journalism Awards 4 2023 awards Toggle 2023 awards subsection 4.1 Lifetime Achievement and Humanitarian of the Year Awards 4.2 Leadership Award 4.3 Restaurant and Chef Awards 4.4 Book Awards 4.5 Broadcast Media Awards 4.6 Journalism Awards 5 2024 awards Toggle 2024 awards subsection 5.1 Lifetime Achievement and Humanitarian of the Year Awards 5.2 Leadership Award 5.3 Restaurant and Chef Awards 5.4 Book Awards 5.5 Broadcast Media Awards 5.6 Journalism Awards 6 2025 awards Toggle 2025 awards subsection 6.1 Restaurant and Chef Awards 6.2 Book Awards 6.3 Broadcast Media Awards [ 53 ] 7 References Toggle the table of contents James Beard Foundation Award: 2020s Add languages Add links Article Talk English Read Edit View history Tools Tools move to sidebar hide Actions Read Edit View history General What links here Related changes Upload file Permanent link Page information Cite this page Get shortened URL Download QR code Print/export Download as PDF Printable version In other projects Wikidata item Appearance move to sidebar hide From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia This article needs to be updated .

But the good news is that we’re open. And that Brandon and I are\\n                still alive! And that somehow, people are coming to our little\\n                restaurant! And, get this: I actually managed to take a picture\\n                of one of the pizzas. Wonder of wonders! I can die happy now.\\n                No, really, right now .\\n                I’m tired. This particular pizza looks sort of cockeyed and misshapen, but\\n                please bear with me. (Secretly, I like them that way.) It also\\n                looks small, because it’s sitting on a huge metal plate. In\\n                person, it’s our normal size, I swear, which is to say about 12\\n                inches in diameter. This pie was a test run one afternoon, when\\n                Brandon bought a case of padron chiles and was trying to decide\\n                how to use them. He tossed them with olive oil and gray salt,\\n                roasted them in a skillet in the wood-fired oven, and then\\n                stemmed them and tore them into strips. They’re medium-hot\\n                – enough to make your lips burn, but not incendiary\\n                – and the best part is, they have a huge amount of flavor\\n                on top of that heat. Maybe this is a useless comparison, but\\n                they remind me of some green chiles that I once had on a\\n                cheeseburger in Albuquerque. (I have a soft spot for New\\n                Mexico.) Anyway, Brandon put his roasted padrons on top of a\\n                pizza with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, aged mozzarella, and\\n                Grana Padano. It’s on the menu now, and we call it the “Padron.”\\n                That’s about as creative as our naming scheme gets around here. It’s hard to say how these first weeks have gone, because we’re\\n                still so much in the thick of it. We’ve been running on\\n                adrenaline, for the most part. But it’s gone as smoothly as I\\n                could have hoped, I think. There have been glitches to work out\\n                in the kitchen, and a certain amount of slowness, and a few\\n                requisite catastrophes: refrigerators breaking, exhaust fans not\\n                working, beer taps not working, my head almost exploding, and so\\n                on. But people are coming in to eat, and we get to cook for\\n                them, and that’s what this is about. When everything goes right,\\n                and when people leave happy, it feels better than almost\\n                anything. Last night was our tenth night open, and for the first\\n                time, just for a second, I was able to look around and smile at\\n                the people at the bar and think, Here we are. We’re actually doing this. Before we started this process, I understood on a cerebral level\\n                that people in the restaurant industry work hard, but I didn’t\\n                really know what that meant. I somehow didn’t realize that\\n                Brandon and I would be at Delancey from 9 am to 1 am the next\\n                day, every day, or that we would be on our feet for 95% of that\\n                time. Granted, we are very, very inefficient right now, and we\\n                have a lot to fix and learn and decide and improve, but there\\n                are certain parts of this work that won’t change. Like the fact\\n                that many of our vendors deliver at nine in the morning, and\\n                that someone has to be there to meet them. And the fact that the\\n                dough has to be made after service each night, around 11 pm. And\\n                after the dough is made, the floor has to be swept and mopped.\\n                You would not believe how much flour\\n                winds up on the floor of a pizzeria. It will not be controlled.\\n                I think it actually breeds at night, while we sleep. It’s\\n                devising a plot to take over the world. I’m sure of it. I know that I have a tendency to make opening a restaurant sound\\n                about as fun as being eaten alive by a bear – and it does\\n                sometimes feel that way – but to be fair, I should tell\\n                you that there’s a lot of magic in it too. Like, for example,\\n                around four in the afternoon, when the servers start to set up\\n                the dining room. I wish you could be there. They set the tables,\\n                light the votives,\"\n}\n**Web Page 5:**\n{\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"title\": \"TOP 10 BEST James Beard Award near Kaneohe, HI 96744 - Yelp\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=James+Beard+Award&find_loc=Kaneohe%2C+HI+96744\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Best James Beard Award near Kaneohe, HI 96744 · 1.

It’s the culinary equivalent of finding a diamond in your backyard—unexpected, authentic, and absolutely worth celebrating. In a world of flashy restaurant concepts and Instagram-engineered food, there’s something profoundly refreshing about a place that simply focuses on doing one thing extraordinarily well. That one thing? Fry bread—the pillowy, golden canvas that serves as the foundation for some of the most satisfying Native American cuisine you’ll find anywhere. Simple wooden tables and chairs say, “We’re not here for the décor.” The real masterpieces at Fry Bread House arrive on your plate, not on the walls. Photo Credit: Austin G. The modest building on North 7th Avenue doesn’t demand attention with neon signs or valet parking. Instead, it quietly stands as a culinary landmark, a place where generations of Phoenicians and visitors have discovered the transformative power of traditional Tohono O’odham recipes. Walking through the door feels like being let in on a delicious secret that locals have been keeping to themselves. The interior is straightforward and unpretentious—wooden tables, simple chairs, and an atmosphere that puts all focus where it belongs: on the food. This isn’t a place designed by consultants to look “authentically rustic” for social media posts. It’s actually authentic, which in today’s world feels almost revolutionary. This menu isn’t just a list of options—it’s a roadmap to Native American culinary treasures. The “Colossal” burro isn’t false advertising; it’s a delicious warning. Photo Credit: Ramon F. The menu board might seem simple at first glance, but it represents centuries of culinary tradition. Each item tells a story of indigenous foodways, of recipes passed down through generations, of techniques perfected long before Arizona was even a state. The star of the show is, of course, the fry bread itself—a perfect balance of crispy exterior and cloud-like interior. It’s the kind of food that makes you wonder how something so simple can taste so complex. The dough is hand-stretched and fried to order, creating a slightly irregular shape that’s the hallmark of something made by human hands rather than machines. When that hot fry bread arrives at your table, still glistening from its bath in hot oil, you’ll understand why people make pilgrimages here from across the Southwest. The Green Chile Stew isn’t playing around. Each spoonful delivers a warm, soul-satisfying hug with chunks of meat swimming in liquid gold. Photo Credit: Rich B. But we’re here to talk about that green chile stew, aren’t we? Let me paint you a picture: tender chunks of meat swimming in a broth that balances heat, tang, and richness in perfect harmony. The green chiles provide both flavor and warmth—not the kind of heat that punishes your taste buds, but the kind that builds slowly, warming you from the inside out. Each spoonful delivers a different experience—here a bite of perfectly tender meat, there the bright pop of chile. It’s the kind of \"\n}\n**Web Page 8:**\n{\n  \"id\": 8,\n  \"title\": \"America's Best Restaurants 2024 - The New York Times\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/dining/best-restaurants-america.html\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"...

We have finished our annual search for America’s best restaurants. Over the last 12 months, reporters and editors traveled to nearly every state scouting restaurants for our annual list. This year, it was about spaces as much as places. We ate hyperlocal dishes served out of a trailer in a rural Virginia field, experienced one of America’s most refined seasonal tasting menus in one of San Francisco’s most refined rooms, dined on Creole fare in a strip mall down the road from NASA in Texas and joined a party behind a tattered ranch house in Johns Island, S.C. Of our choices, 32 are new, opened since the 2023 list was assembled. But we also made space for longstanding restaurants still in top form, including one that opened in 1976. As always, there were no-brainers and tough choices — the United States has a vast, diverse spread of great restaurants these days — but these are our 50 favorites for 2024.

You will be better off with a big group. And you will want cocktails. One of only three restaurants in the United States that serves the mookata style of Thai cooking — the other two are in Queens and San Francisco — Mr. Baan’s is the next-door sibling to Phoenix’s acclaimed Lom Wong . The mookata setup is a dome-shaped charcoal-fired grill on which you cook your own soy-marinated pork, coriander beef or black-pepper chicken. Surrounding the dome is a moat filled with already rich pork broth that is further fortified by the meat drippings. To this, you add noodles, minced pork, vegetables, mushrooms and various sauces to create a soup of your own specifications, hot-pot style. It’s a party, and, never fear, refills on all elements are included. BRIAN GALLAGHER new Quince San Francisco • Seasonal Tasting Menu • Opened 2003, Reopened 2023 • quincerestaurant.com Øivind Haug After more than 20 years, dinner at Michael and Lindsay Tusk’s Quince is still a master class in the NorCal culinary vernacular. The produce, much of it grown 30 miles up the coast in Bolinas, is superb. And naturally, the menu changes with the seasons. But Mr. Tusk’s dishes — a roasted spiny lobster with black trumpet mushrooms and fava greens, for instance, or sunchoke velouté with a local oyster, chanterelles and sorrel — are a deft balance of cheffing and sourcing. The recently redesigned space feels at once contemporary and timeless. The elegantly spare décor and widely spaced tables are de rigueur for a three-Michelin-starred restaurant, but the dining room is warmed by Ms. Tusk’s presiding presence. Dinner is an expensive occasion at $390 a person (though you can have a four-course lunch for $175). But when you imagine a perfect California fine-dining restaurant, you’re imagining Quince. You just may not know it until you eat there. BRIAN GALLAGHER new Four Kings San Francisco • Cantonese American • Opened March 2024 • itsfourkings.com Pete Lee Four Kings is breathing much-needed fire into San Francisco’s dining scene. The chefs Franky Ho and Mike Long, from the acclaimed Mister Jiu’s, and their partners Millie Boonkokua and Lucy Li have conjured a restaurant where the surgical precision of their fine-dining past flows as an undercurrent. But the spot-on vibes and energetic dishes are singular here. Nuggets of XO escargot are tucked into shells blanketed with a buttery sheen, served with pillowy milk bread. Sichuan cabbage presents as deceivingly simple on the menu, but surprises as one of the best dishes thanks to a generous dusting of scallion powder. And that’s what Four Kings will do: grab you in a way that’s bold, exhilarating and needed.

        "turn_1_webpage_analyses": "From the provided web pages, the most relevant information pertains to **Papa Felipe's Mexican Restaurant** in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The restaurant was highlighted in the Sterns' *Roadfood* guide (a resource often referenced by culinary experts) for its unique **green chile carne adovada**, a variation of a traditional New Mexican dish. While the search query specifies \"green chile stew,\" Papa Felipe's is noted for its innovative use of green chile in dishes like their \"green tamale pie\" and green chile marinade for carne adovada.  A key detail is that the Sterns' *Roadfood* book series is mentioned as a trusted source for regional American cuisine, which may align with the search for a **book recommended by James Beard Award winners**. However, none of the pages explicitly mention **Ali's Kitchen** or a direct James Beard Award win for the restaurant in 2015. The closest match is **Fry Bread House** in Arizona (mentioned in Web Page 7), which won a James Beard Award (America's Classics category) but is not in New Mexico.  **Conclusion:**  While no direct reference to \"Ali's Kitchen\" or a 2015 James Beard Award for a New Mexican restaurant with green chile stew was found, **Papa Felipe's** emerges as a prominent New Mexican restaurant highlighted in culinary guides for its green chile-infused dishes. The *Roadfood* book by the Sterns is a likely candidate for the recommended source."

Scroll down to the Wikipedia listing \"Survivor (American TV Series)\".\n    Search, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(American_TV_series),  \n2.I begin to make a list of all the Survivor winners and their seasons. \n3.I google \"survivor cast CBS\" and click on cast tab at cbs.com (https://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/cast/). It features the players of the most recently aired season. I click on the Seasons tab and scroll down to the first season. I find the winner from the first season (based on my list compiled from the en.wikipedia.org site mentioned in step 1) and scroll through the bio information until I see the mention of their birthday. It is usually contained in the last sentence of the bio. I repeat this process until I get to Season 18. It is at this point that CBS starts to omit the full birthdays. For seasons 18 and 19 they include the month and date but omit the year. By Season 20, the birthday is omitted completely. \n4. So now I am making a simple template entry in google for each successive winner: When was (insert winner's name), winner of (insert season they won) of Survivor born?  There are usually two prominent sites I look for in my Google feed for this information:\n\n             1. Wikipedia page for that contestant: ex.: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._T._Thomas_(Survivor_contestant)\n             2. Survivor Wiki: ex.: https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/J.T._Thomas   \n                Overall I have found the fan pages to be pretty reliable. If both options were available, I did take the opportunity to verify \n                that they matched up. I did not find any discrepancies (as far as birthdays) between the two.\n\n5. Now I have a list of all forty of the winners from the first forty seasons of Survivor (two of them have won twice). I comb the list and \nnote the months when they are mentioned and how many times that they appear.

The American series premiered on May 31, 2000, on CBS . It is hosted by Jeff Probst , who is also an executive producer along with Mark Burnett and the original creator, Parsons. Survivor places a group of people in an isolated location, where they must provide food, fire, and shelter for themselves. The contestants compete in challenges including testing the contestants' physical abilities like running and swimming or their mental abilities like puzzles and endurance challenges for rewards and immunity from elimination. The contestants are progressively eliminated from the game as they are voted out by their fellow contestants until only two or three remain. At that point, the contestants who were eliminated vote for the winner. They are given the title of \\\"Sole Survivor\\\" and are awarded the grand prize of $1,000,000 ($2,000,000 in Winners at War ). The American version has been very successful. From the 2000–01 through the 2005–06 television seasons, its first 11 seasons (competitions) rated among the top 10 most-watched shows. It is commonly considered the leader of American reality TV because it was the first highly rated and profitable reality show on broadcast television in the U.S., and is considered one of the best shows of the 2000s (decade). [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] The series has been nominated for 63 Emmy Awards , including winning for Outstanding Sound Mixing in 2001, Outstanding Special Class Program in 2002, and was subsequently nominated four times for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program when the category was introduced in 2003. Probst won the award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program four consecutive times after the award was introduced in 2008. [ 4 ] In 2007, the series was included in Time magazine's list of the 100 greatest TV shows of all time. [ 5 ] In 2013, TV Guide ranked it at No. 39 on its list of the \\\"60 Best Series of All Time\\\". [ 6 ] In May 2025, the series was renewed for the 2025–26 television season for its 49th and 50th seasons, continuing with 90-minute episodes. [ 7 ] Season 49 will premiere on September 24, 2025. [ 8 ] Format and rules [ edit ] Further information: Survivor (franchise) § Format The first American season of Survivor followed the same general format as the Swedish series. Sixteen or more players, split between two or more \\\"tribes\\\", are taken to a remote isolated location (usually in a tropical climate) and are forced to live off the land with meager supplies for 39 days (42 in The Australian Outback , 26 in post- COVID seasons). [ a ] Frequent physical and mental challenges are used to pit the teams against each other for rewards, such as food or luxuries, or for \\\"immunity\\\", forcing the other tribe to attend \\\"Tribal Council\\\", where they must vote off one of their tribemates. Signaling the halfway point in the game, survivors from both tribes come together to live as one, making it to the \\\"merge\\\". At this point, survivors will compete against each other to win individual immunity; winning immunity prevents that player from being voted out at Tribal Council. Most players that are voted out after the merge form the game's \\\"jury\\\". Once the group gets down to two or three people, a Final Tribal Council is held where the remaining players plead their case to the jury members. The jury then votes for which player should be considered the \\\"Sole Survivor\\\" and win the show's grand prize. In all seasons for the American version (excluding Survivor: Winners at War whose winner won $2 million), this has included a $1-million prize in addition to the Sole Survivor title; some seasons (particularly earlier seasons) have included additional prizes offered during the game, such as a car, as well as fan-favorite prizes awarded at the finale. All contestants are paid on a sliding scale based on the order they were voted out: the firs\"\n}\n**Web Page 5:**\n{\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"title\": \"'Survivor' Winners Through the Years: Where Are They Now?\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/pictures/survivor-winners-through-the-years-where-are-they-now/\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Us Weekly looks back at every star to win 'Survivor' and what they're up to today — read more.\",\n  \"context\": \"‘Survivor’ Winners Through the Years: Where Are They Now? | Us Weekly Celebrity News Entertainment Star Style Parenting Shopping Royals Games Shorts Open menu button Celebrity News Trending Exclusives Love Lives Hot Pics Stars Are Just Like Us View All Entertainment TV Movies Music Sports Reality TV Watch With Us Country Music Us Has Thoughts View All Star Style Fashion Beauty Hair View All Lifestyle Parenting Pets Food Real Estate Wellness View All Shopping Deals Fashion Beauty Wellness Home Gift Guides View All Games Crosswords Word Search Jigsaw Quizzes View All Royals Prince William Kate Middleton Prince Harry Meghan Markle King Charles View All Photos Videos Shorts Us Weekly en ESPAÑOL Newsletters Digital Edition Subscribe Subscription Services Cancel Subscription Got a Tip for Us?

Appearances Every season The Sole Survivor is the title held by the winner of the American reality television series Survivor , as determined by a plurality of votes from the jury , whose task is to award the title to the castaway it believes to have most thoroughly embodied the game's three-word slogan: \\\"Outwit, Outplay, Outlast.\\\" Contents 1 Criteria 2 Prizes 3 List of Sole Survivors 3.1 U.S. 3.2 International 4 Survivor: Winners at War 5 Trivia 5.1 Winning and Perfect Games 5.2 Tribal Council 5.3 Hidden Immunity Idol and Twists 5.4 Challenge Wins 5.5 Returning Winners 6 See also 7 References Criteria [ ] To be awarded the title of Sole Survivor, a contestant must reach the final day of the game and secure a plurality of the jury votes. On the final evening, the Final Tribal Council takes place, where the finalists face questioning by the jury. The jury can ask any questions or make statements to inform their voting decision. The finalists in turn may answer the question or explain their actions  during the game. Since there is no objective definition of 'best' in this context, the strategies that lead to victory and the jurors' reasons for voting have varied greatly throughout the series' history. However, jury members are generally expected to elect a winner who best embodies the show's three-word motto: \\\"Outwit, Outplay, Outlast\\\": Outwit: The social element, it involves achieving one's strategic goals without sacrificing social relationships or alienating other contestants. A strong candidate will have maintained the respect of the jury while effectively navigating the social dynamics of the game. Outplay: The strategic element, it encompasses outmaneuvering other contestants and eliminating them in ways that benefit one's long-term success. This includes forming and managing alliances, executing blindsides, and utilizing, or at least using the information surrounding Hidden Immunity Idols and other advantages . A strategic player demonstrates guile, deception, and strategic acumen. Outlast: The physical element, it involves enduring the game's physical hardships, such as harsh weather, grueling challenges , and deprivation of necessities and luxuries. The Sole Survivor not only endures these difficulties but does so with resilience and perseverance. It is important to note that likability and respect are not always synonymous in the game of Survivor . Sometimes, a strategically dominant player may win despite being less likable, while at other times, a more sociable player may win due to their character quality, even if another finalist was more strategically active but socially inept. Ultimately, the jury's decision reflects their personal criteria for who best fulfilled \\\"Outwit, Outplay, Outlast.\\\" The finalists must present compelling arguments highlighting their strengths and mitigating their weaknesses during the Final Tribal Council. The jury votes for the finalist they feel most comfortable losing to, regardless of their reasoning. Prizes [ ] The Sole Survivor receives a check of $1,000,000, to be received after the season finale. From Survivor: The Australian Outback to Survivor: Panama , the winners additionally received a car that is usually similar to the one given at the Reward Challenge where a car was also given, though this has been abandoned since Survivor: Cook Islands . The winner, and all contestants present at the live Reunion Show will also receive an extra $10,000 appearance fee, which immediately follows the finale broadcast. From Survivor: Panama to Survivor: Caramoan , the Sole Survivor was also eligible to win the Fan Favorite Award .

Contestants are referred to as \\\"castaways\\\", and they compete against one another to become the \\\"Sole Survivor\\\" and win one million U.S. dollars . First airing in 2000, there currently have been a total of 48 seasons aired. The program itself has been filmed on five continents. Contestants usually apply to be on the show, but the series has been known to recruit contestants for various seasons. For Survivor: Fiji , the producers had hoped to have a more racially diverse cast, and hoped that a more diverse group would apply after the success of the racially segregated Survivor: Cook Islands . When this did not happen, the producers turned to recruiting and in the end, only one contestant had actually submitted an application to be on the show. [ 1 ] For the most part, contestants are virtually unknown prior to their Survivor appearance, but occasionally some well-known people are cast. A total of 733 participants (castaways) have competed so far (as of Survivor 48 ). 104 of those participants have competed in multiple seasons: 75 of them have competed in two seasons, 23 have competed in three seasons, six have competed in four seasons, and Rob Mariano has competed in five seasons of the show. Fifteen seasons have featured  or will feature returning players: five with all-returnees ( Survivor: All-Stars in 2004, Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains in 2010, [ 2 ] Survivor: Cambodia in 2015, Survivor: Game Changers in 2017, Survivor: Winners at War in 2020 and the upcoming Survivor 50 [ 3 ] ), [ 4 ] six with one to four returning players on tribes with new players ( Survivor: Guatemala in 2005, Survivor: Redemption Island and Survivor: South Pacific in 2011, [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Survivor: Philippines in 2012, Survivor: Edge of Extinction in 2019 and Survivor 45 in 2023), [ 7 ] two with a tribe of ten returning \\\"Favorites\\\" facing off against a tribe of ten \\\"Fans\\\" ( Survivor: Micronesia in 2008 and Survivor: Caramoan in 2013), and one featuring a tribe of ten returning players playing against a tribe of their family members ( Survivor: Blood vs. Water in 2013). Additionally, five contestants (Russell Hantz, Sandra Diaz-Twine, Cirie Fields, Parvati Shallow, Tony Vlachos) have competed on international editions of the series (namily, Australian Survivor , with Fields, Shallow and Vlachos competing on the international cross-over season, Australian Survivor: Australia V The World ) On two occasions, contestants have been cast but ultimately withdrew before the game began without being replaced: a 20th contestant, model agency owner Mellisa McNulty, was originally cast in Survivor: Fiji , but dropped out and returned home the night before the show began because of panic attacks, [ 8 ] while in Survivor: San Juan del Sur , the 19th and 20th contestants, sisters So and Doo Kim, were removed just before filming due to a medical emergency. [ 9 ] So would later appear on the following season Survivor: Worlds Apart . Fiji and San Juan del Sur proceeded with an uneven gender balance. But because Fiji had only one player withdraw, it is the only season in the history of the show to start with an odd number of players.

He also competed on Survivor: Game Changers and Survivor: Australia v The World . In Cagayan , Tony played the game with ferocity, occupying a high-profile leadership role for much of the game, constructing \\\"spy shacks\\\" to eavesdrop on his tribemates, double-crossing his own allies, swearing on relatives both alive and dead, and finding three Hidden Immunity Idols , including one with \\\" special powers \\\". He frequently turned on his majority Solana Alliance in order to engineer a variety of blindsides, and convinced Woo Hwang to take him to the Final Two over the unpopular Kass McQuillen . His hyperactive strategic game won him the title of Sole Survivor in a 8-1 vote. Tony's aggressive gameplay made him an early target in Game Changers . He attempted to build an alliance consisting of the biggest threats in the game, but it did not go as planned due to his lack of trust in Sandra Diaz-Twine . When it became clear that the two could not coexist in the same alliance, Sandra turned their entire tribe on Tony, voting him out on Day 6. Having learned from his past mistakes, Tony kept a low profile for a good portion in Winners at War by playing patiently, reaffirming  his Cops-R-Us alliance with Cagayan castmate Sarah Lacina , and building stronger personal relationships with his tribe. At the merge , wanting to keep those he perceived to be bigger threats around, Tony rallied these players against those he saw as maintaining a low profile. Tony steadily played more aggressively towards the endgame, eliminating anyone he saw as a threat and taking control of the game. Despite his rapid rise to power, he was able to consolidate trust with a strong alliance by forging crucial social bonds which insulated him from elimination. He also emerged as a challenge threat, winning four Immunity Challenges . On Day 38, Tony won the fire-making challenge against Sarah to reach the Final Tribal Council , where his dominant gameplay resulted in him winning the title of Sole Survivor in a 12-4-0 vote, making him the second two-time winner in Survivor history. Due to his status as the second two-time winner, the dominance with which he played over the two seasons he won and his versatility as a player, Tony is considered to be one of the greatest players of the series.

The team finished with a record of 100–62 and won the World Series . The series victory was the 21st title in franchise history and the first under the ownership of George Steinbrenner . New York was managed by Billy Martin and played at Yankee Stadium in The Bronx . The season was brought to life years later in the book and drama-documentary The Bronx is Burning . The Yankees also hosted the 1977 Major League Baseball All-Star Game . To date, this is the most recent time the All-Star Game host team has won the World Series the same year. Offseason [ edit ] The Yankees signed Reggie Jackson to a five-year contract, totaling $ 2.96 million, on November 29, 1976. Upon arriving in New York, Jackson asked for uniform number 9, which he had worn in Oakland and Baltimore . However, that number was being worn by third baseman Graig Nettles . So, noting that then-all-time home run leader Hank Aaron had just retired, Jackson asked for and received number 44, Aaron's number. Notable transactions [ edit ] November 5, 1976: Jim Mason was drafted from the Yankees by the Toronto Blue Jays as the 30th pick in the 1976 MLB expansion draft . [ 1 ] January 11, 1977: Willie McGee was drafted by the Yankees in the first round (15th pick) of the 1977 Major League Baseball draft (secondary phase) and he signed on June 6. [ 2 ] January 20, 1977: Elliott Maddox and Rick Bladt were traded by the Yankees to the Baltimore Orioles for Paul Blair . [ 3 ] February 17, 1977: Sandy Alomar Sr. was traded by the Yankees to the Texas Rangers for Brian Doyle , Greg Pryor and cash. [ 4 ] March 26, 1977: Kerry Dineen was traded by the Yankees to the Philadelphia Phillies for Sergio Ferrer . [ 5 ] Regular season [ edit ] The team finished in first place in the American League East with a record of 100–62 (.617),  2½ games ahead of the Baltimore Orioles to successfully defend their division title. In the best-of-five League Championship Series (ALCS), they beat the Kansas City Royals in five games. In the World Series , New York defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in six games.

Manager Billy Martin responded with a revamped batting order, purportedly drawn from a hat, on April 20 against the Toronto Blue Jays at Yankee Stadium. The new lineup produced New York’s most robust offensive performance to date in a 7-5 win over the Blue Jays, beginning the Yankees’ climb toward a World Series title and catalyzing second baseman Willie Randolph ’s emergence as a top-of-the-lineup hitter. The 1976 Yankees, in Martin’s first full season at the helm, won the franchise’s first pennant in 12 seasons before falling to the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series . During the 1976-77 offseason – baseball’s first under a collective bargaining agreement formalizing free agency – New York added two of the market’s biggest names: right fielder Jackson, who had spent 1976 with the Baltimore Orioles after establishing himself as a superstar with the Oakland A’s; and lefty starter Gullett, Cincinnati’s winning pitcher in Game One of the 1976 World Series, one of 10 postseason starts before his 26th birthday. 1 But the Yankees opened 1977 by winning just two of their first 10 games. After New York mustered only one win in six games against the Milwaukee Brewers, who had finished last in the AL East in 1976, 2 the expansion Blue Jays won the first two games of their first-ever visit to the Bronx. 3 Losers of five in a row, scoring fewer than three runs per game, the Yankees were already 5½ games back in the division. Various measures – authoritarian, superstitious, and tactical – were employed to jump-start the Yankees. Owner George Steinbrenner called for a voluntary workout on an offday, then a team meeting before the second Toronto loss. 4 Martin shaved off his mustache for better luck. 5 A mild lineup makeover for April 13’s 5-3 win over the Kansas City Royals, New York’s biggest offensive outburst in its first 10 games, had catcher Thurman Munson – the regular number-three hitter – batting second; Jackson shifted from fifth to third; and left fielder Roy White , generally in the second slot, at sixth. 6 Still, the Yankees’ slide persisted. “Everything has gone awry,” observed Newsday . “Nobody is hitting. … The defense is suddenly shabby. A pack of writers wait every day in the [locker room]. The headlines the next morning scream at them.” 7 After the second loss to the Blue Jays on April 19, Martin announced that the Yankees would deploy a radically revamped batting order for the next day’s game. 8 Newspapers reported that Martin – aided by Jackson and venerable clubhouse man Pete Sheehy – had picked the lineup “out of a hat” as the 8-3 defeat ran its course. 9 But Martin’s lineup card for Wednesday afternoon’s game was not completely unfamiliar. As they had a week earlier in Kansas City, Munson and Jackson batted second and third, and White was sixth. With right-hander Steve Hargan pitching for Toronto, designated hitter Carlos May , a lefty who had hit fifth through seventh in earlier games against righties, was seventh. Shortstop Bucky Dent , acquired from the Chicago White Sox two days before Opening Day, 10 batted ninth, just as he had for New York’s first 10 games. Other Yankees had more unusual roles. Leading off was the 22-year-old Randolph, New York’s regular eighth hitter but an AL All-Star in 1976, his first full major-league season. 11 Veteran center fielder Mickey Rivers , the usual leadoff man, shifted to fifth for the first time in his career. Graig Nettles , the AL’s leading home-run hitter in 1976, was at cleanup instead of his customary sixth or seventh. Eighth was Chris Chambliss , generally fourth or fifth but batting nearly 100 points below his career .283 average. 12 Before the Yankees could test out their new order, Toronto went ahead against Gullett, seeking his first win of 1977 after two losses to Milwaukee. A single by former Yankee Otto Vélez – who had four hits and four RBIs in the series’ first two games – drove in Hector Torres , and Bob Bailor scored on Doug Ault ’s groundout for a 2-0 Blue Jays’ lead. Toronto had selected Har\"\n}\n**Web Page 9:**\n{\n  \"id\": 9,\n  \"title\": \"Yankees of the Decade: The best from 1971-80 - Elite Sports NY\",\n  \"url\": \"https://elitesportsny.com/2022/02/27/yankees-of-the-decade-the-best-from-1971-80/\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"1.

We’re only two days away from MLB officially canceling regular season games, and yet here we are still looking back fondly on periods of New York Yankees history. Over the past few days, we’ve been looking at the top ten Yankees players by decade based on their WAR (per Baseball-Reference). Most recently, we covered Don Mattingly’s prime years in the 1980s. This time, we strap on our platform shoes and turn on some disco to look at which New York Yankees defined the 1970s. 1. Thurman Munson — 40.2 (1971-79) A baseball player in every sense of the word, the Ohio-born Munson was many a Yankees fan’s favorite player in the ’70s. Munson was a seven-time All-Star who won three Gold Gloves and two World Series rings with New York before his tragic death in a plane crash in 1979. The former Yankee captain also hit .357 in the playoffs and was the AL MVP in 1976. 2. Graig Nettles — 38.4 (1973-80) When he wasn’t fielding his way to two Gold Gloves, Nettles was nothing but a great teammate with the New York Yankees. The five-time Yankees All-Star third baseman was always front and center when things got scrappy and hit 250 of his 390 career homers in pinstripes. Two World Series rings were a nice bonus too. 3. Roy White — 31.4 (1971-79) By today’s standard, White might have been an analytics superstar. The switch-hitter was never an elite hitter, but held his own while keeping his walks up and his strikeouts down. White was also highly durable, rarely ever missing time, and was an elite defensive outfielder in his time. 4. Willie Randolph — 27.3 (1976-80) Randolph was just 21 years old when he debuted with the Yankees in 1976, and the rest is history. He made the first of six career All-Star teams and his slick fielding and quick legs were instrumental in New York’s winning three consecutive AL pennants. Randolph later returned to the Yankees as a coach and is still beloved by fans to this day. Ron Guidry — 23.9 (1975-80) Whether you called him “Louisiana Lightning” or “Gator,” the Cajun-born Guidry did more than win two World Series with the Yankees in the ’70s. In 1978, he turned in one of the most dominant seasons in MLB history, going 25-3 with a 1.74 ERA. Guidry also led the majors in ERA+, FIP, WHIP, and H/9 en route to a unanimous Cy Young win, and he finished second in MVP voting behind Red Sox outfielder Jim Rice. 6. Bobby Murcer — 21.1 (1971-74, ’79-80) Long considered the outfield heir to fellow Oklahoman Mickey Mantle, Murcer was as advertised and a bright spot for the struggling Yankees of the early ’70s. He made four straight All-Star teams before he was unceremoniously traded to the Giants for Bobby Bonds in 1975, then also played for the Cubs before returning to the Bronx in 1979. Shortly after, Murcer carried the Yankees to victory just four days after his good friend Thurman Munson’s death. Murcer was also a beloved Yankees broadcaster in retirement. 7. Reggie Jackson — 16.2 (1977-80) Jackson came to the Yankees as a blockbuster free agent, signing a five-year deal worth a then-record 2.96 million. When he wasn’t courting controversy, Mr. October was either slugging home runs in the playoffs or in the regular season. He hit .300 with an AL-best 41 home runs in 1980 and hit .289 with 129 longballs from 1977-80. 8. Chris Chambliss — 15.4 (1974-80) It’s easy to miss just how consistent Chambliss was as a Yankee. He played strong defense at first base, hit .282 in pinstripes, and batted .307 in the playoffs. Chambliss won two World Series rings as a player, and then added four more as Joe Torre’s hitting coach during the ’90s dynasty. 9. Mickey Rivers — 15.1 (197\"\n}\n**Web Page 10:**\n{\n  \"id\": 10,\n  \"title\": \"1977 New York Yankees Hitting Stats - Baseball Almanac\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.baseball-almanac.com/teamstats/hitting.php?y=1977&t=NYA\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Which hitters from the 1977 New York Yankees played the most games by each position?

Major League Baseball (Rule 10.22 Minimum Standards for Individual Championships) states, \\\"The individual batting, slugging or on-base percentage champion shall be the player with the highest batting average, slugging percentage or on-base percentage, as the case may be, provided the player is credited with as many or more total appearances at the plate in league championship games as the number of games scheduled for each club in his clubs league that season, multiplied by 3.1 in the case of a Major League player and by 2.7 in the case of a National Association player. Total appearances at the plate shall include official times at bat, plus bases on balls, times hit by pitcher, sacrifice hits, sacrifice flies and times awarded first base because of interference or obstruction. Notwithstanding the foregoing requirement of minimum appearances at the plate, any player with fewer than the required number of plate appearances whose average would be the highest, if he were charged with the required number of plate appearances shall be awarded the batting, slugging or on-base percentage championship, as the case may be.

Introduction with Text of “Father Son and Holy Ghost” Although Audre Lorde is well known as a black lesbian poet, who wrote on issues of identity, she also wrote more personal pieces that address themes common to all of humanity.  The death of a father is one such theme. In her elegy “Father Son and Holy Ghost,” Lorde creates a speaker, who is remembering various aspects of her father’s behavior while he was alive.  But she begins by strangely emphasizing that she has not as yet visited her father’s grave. That admission alerts the reader that the poem is focusing on earlier memories.  While that first impression prompts questions in the reader’s mind, answers begin to form in the second movement.  Another question might be begged regarding the title and what it implies. By invoking the Christian Holy Trinity , the speaker is implying that the spiritual nature of her memory will include three levels of understanding of the father:  he was the progenitor of the speaker (Father), he lived a life of consistent, respectable, and moral behavior (Son), and he revered his wife, the mother of his children (Holy Ghost). Her admiration for her father is displayed in a Dickinsonian, elliptical style; the poet has not added any unnecessary word to her drama. For example, instead of merely stating that her father arrived home in the evening, grasped the doorknob, and entered the home, she shrinks all of that information in “our evening doorknobs.” Because doorknobs remain the same whether it be morning, noon, evening, or night, the speaker metaphorically places the time of her father’s arrival by describing the doorknob by the time of day of his arrival. Father Son and Holy Ghost I have not ever seen my father’s grave. Not that his judgment eyes have been forgotten nor his great hands’ print on our evening doorknobs one half turn each night and he would come drabbled with the world’s business massive and silent as the whole day’\"\n}\n**Web Page 4:**\n{\n  \"id\": 4,\n  \"title\": \"Audre Lorde - Poetry Foundation\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/audre-lorde\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"The Collected Poems of Audre Lorde was published in 1997.

Explaining the genesis of “Power,” a poem about the police shooting of a ten-year-old black child, Lorde discussed her feelings when she learned that the officer involved had been acquitted: “A kind of fury rose up in me; the sky turned red. I felt so sick. I felt as if I would drive this car into a wall, into the next person I saw. So I pulled over. I took out my journal just to air some of my fury, to get it out of my fingertips. Those expressed feelings are that poem.” Her poetry, and “indeed all of her writing,” according to contributor Joan Martin in Black Women Writers (1950-1980): A Critical Evaluation, “rings with passion, sincerity, perception, and depth of feeling.” Concerned with modern society’s tendency to categorize groups of people, Lorde fought the marginalization of such categories as “lesbian” and “black woman.” She was central to many liberation movements and activist circles, including second-wave feminism, civil rights and Black cultural movements, and struggles for LGBTQ equality. In particular, Lorde’s poetry is known for the power of its call for social and racial justice, as well as its depictions of queer experience and sexuality. As she told interviewer Charles H. Rowell in Callaloo: “My sexuality is part and parcel of who I am, and my poetry comes from the intersection of me and my worlds… [White, arch-conservative senator] Jesse Helms’s objection to my work is not about obscenity … or even about sex. It is about revolution and change.” Lorde was a noted prose writer as well as poet. Her account of her struggle to overcome breast cancer and mastectomy, The Cancer Journals (1980), is regarded as a major work of illness narrative . In The Cancer Journals, Lorde confronts the possibility of death. Recounting this personal transformation led Lorde to address the silence surrounding cancer, illness, and the lived experience of women. For example, Lorde explained her decision not to wear a prosthesis after undergoing a mastectomy in the Journals: “Prosthesis offers the empty comfort of ‘Nobody will know the difference.’ But it is that very difference which I wish to affirm, because I have lived it, and survived it, and wish to share that strength with other women. If we are to translate the silence surrounding breast cancer into language and action against this scourge, then the first step is that women with mastectomies must become visible to each other.” Lorde’s 1982 novel, Zami: A New Spelling of My Name, was described by its publishers as a “biomythography, combining elements of history, biography and myth.” Sister Outsider: Essays and Speeches (1984) collected Lorde’s nonfiction prose and has become a canonical text in Black studies, women’s studies, and queer theory. Another  collection of essays, A Burst of Light (1988), won the National Book Award. The Collected Poems of Audre Lorde was published in 1997. In 1981 Lorde and fellow writers Cherríe Moraga and Barbara Smith founded Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press, which was dedicated to furthering the writings of black feminists. Lorde would also become increasingly concerned over the plight of black women in South Africa under apartheid, creating Sisterhood in Support of Sisters in South Africa and remaining an active voice on behalf of these women throughout the remainder of her life. Lorde addressed her concerns to not only the United States but the world, encouraging a celebration of the differences that society instead used as tools of isolation. As Allison Kimmich noted in Feminist Writers, “Throughout all of Audre Lorde’s writing, both nonfiction and fiction, a single theme surfaces repeatedly. The black lesbian feminist poet activist reminds her readers that they ignore differences among people at their peril … Instead, Lorde suggests, differences in race or class must serve as a ‘reason for celebration and growth.’” Lorde’s honors and awards included a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. A professor of English at John Jay College and Hunter College, Lorde was poet laureate of New York from 1991-1992. Warrior Poet (2006), by Alexis De Veaux, is the first full-length biography of Audre Lorde.

Nearsighted to the point of being legally blind, and the youngest of three daughters (her sisters named Phyllis and Helen), Lorde grew up hearing her mother's stories about the West Indies. She learned to talk while she learned to read, at the age of four, and her mother taught her to write at around the same time. She wrote her first poem when she was in eighth grade. Born Audrey Geraldine Lorde, she chose to drop the \\\"y\\\" from her name while still a child, explaining in Zami: A New Spelling of My Name, that she was more interested in the artistic symmetry of the \\\"e\\\"-endings in the two side-by-side names \\\"Audre Lorde\\\" than in spelling her name the way her parents had intended. After graduating from Hunter College High School and experiencing the grief of her best friend Genevieve \\\"Gennie\\\" Thompson's death, Lorde immediately left her parents' home and became estranged from her family. She attended Hunter College from 1954 to 1959 and graduated with a bachelor's degree. While studying library science, Lorde supported herself by working various odd jobs such as factory worker, ghost writer, social worker, X-ray technician, medical clerk, and arts and crafts supervisor, moving out of Harlem to Stamford, Connecticut and beginning to explore her lesbian sexuality. In 1954, she spent a pivotal year as a student at the National University of Mexico, a period she described as a time of affirmation and renewal: she confirmed her identity on personal and artistic levels as a lesbian and poet. On her return to New York, she attended college, worked as a librarian, continued writing and became an active participant in the gay culture of Greenwich Village. She furthered her education at Columbia University, earning a master's degree in library science in 1961. She also worked during this time as a librarian at Mount Vernon Public Library and married attorney Edwin Rollins; they divorced in 1970 after having two children, Elizabeth and Jonathan. In 1966, Lorde became head librarian at Town School Library in New York City, where she remained until 1968. www.PoemHunter.com - The World's Poetry Archive 1In 1968 Lorde was writer-in-residence at Tougaloo College in Mississippi, where she met Frances Clayton, a white professor of psychology, who was to be her romantic partner until 1989. From 1977 to 1978 Lorde had a brief affair with the sculptor and painter Mildred Thompson. The two met in Nigeria in 1977 at the Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture (FESTAC 77). Their affair ran its course during the time that Thompson lived in Washington, D.C. and was teaching at Howard University. Lorde died on November 17, 1992, in St. Croix, (where she had been living with Gloria I. Joseph), after a 14-year struggle with breast cancer. She was 58.

The repeated image of the “grave” in the first and last lines is connected to the repeated image of “earth” (Lines 3 and 25) in “Coal.” Looking at the two poems together, the underground is a place of both death and birth. “ Who Said It Was Simple ” by Audre Lorde (1973) This poem appears in Lorde's book From a Land Where Other People Live . Like “Coal,” this poem discusses race. It also includes a more direct discussion of gender than “Coal,” as Lorde wonders about her liberation as a Black woman. “Who Said It Was Simple” is similar to “Coal” in that both contain elements from nature. The tree “roots” (Line 1) in “Who Said It Was Simple” can be compared to the “earth” (Lines 3 and 25) in “Coal.” “ From the House of Yemanjá ” by Audre Lorde (1978) This poem appears in Lorde’s book The Black Unicorn and takes a different, more autobiographical look at Lorde’s relationship to her mother.

Written by people who wish to remain anonymous For Each of You This is an instructional poem. From one who has lived and made mistakes and learned, Lorde is telling others what works for her, what she's learned. Some seems like common sense advice, but much of it is emboldening. Lorde almost seems to be giving her readers permission to do something nobody says you can do: what you want. Among her encouragement's she says to stay true to your inner motivations, try everything, accept responsibility for mistakes, love as deserved, know truth, commit, and give inheritance to those you consider your kids. Never to Dream of Spiders This poem is discusses the complexities of social expectations, racism, and violence. At the beginning, Lorde writes about someone injured and falling in a crowd. As the person falls, that person loses sensations and gains an awareness of a universal self -- being one with all the people that are nearby. As consciousness fades, memories drift back. The person desperately tries to remember specific things, but cannot force them to come. They see life fading into death and whatever monumental events lie beyond. A dog catches hold of them, and hoses are sprayed on the crowd. In the moment of death, the fallen person understands that they will not be forgotten -- spiders will not form cobwebs upon their memory. Father Son and Holy Ghost Writing about her father's death, Lorde confesses some fears and regrets to her readers. She says she has never visited his grave once. As vividly as the days they happened, she remembers memories of him when she was a girl. He would tuck the kids in at night. He dated many women, trying to find someone to replace the wife he had loved and lost too early. To Lorde, the saddest part about his death is that he will only ever know the her that she was up to the day of his death. Whatever he was ever to think about her was finished that day, so she did the same for him. By not visiting his grace, she is preserving the memory of him as he was before death; he remains alive in her memory forever. Update this section!

        "turn_1_webpage_analyses": "The full text of Audre Lorde's poem \"Father Son and Holy Ghost\" is available from **Web Page 1 (The Poetry Foundation)** and **Web Page 7 (PoemHunter PDF)**. Below is the poem with key stanzas and indented lines highlighted (indentation is preserved as indicated by spacing in the text):---**Father Son and Holy Ghost**  I have not ever seen my father’s grave.  Not that his judgment eyes have been forgotten  nor his great hands’ print on our evening doorknobs  one half turn each night and he would come  drabbled with the world’s business  massive and silent as the whole day’s wish  ready to redefine each of our shapes  but now the evening doorknobs wait     and do not recognize us as we pass.  Each week a different woman  regular as his one quick glass each evening  pulls up the grass his stillness grows  calling it weed.  Each week     a different woman has my mother’s face  and he who time has     changeless must be amazed  who knew and loved but one.  My father died in silence loving creation  and well-defined response  he lived    still judgments on familiar things  and died    knowing a January 15th that year me.  Lest I go into dust  I have not ever seen my father’s grave.  ---### Key Observations:  1. **Indented Lines**:     - The lines *\"wait    and do not recognize us as we pass\"* and *\"a different woman has my mother’s face\"* include significant spacing (likely indicating indentation).     - The lines *\"changeless must be amazed\"* and *\"died    knowing a January 15th that year me\"* also use spacing to create pauses or emphasis.  2. **Structure**:     - The poem begins and ends with the refrain *\"I have not ever seen my father’s grave,\"* framing the speaker’s unresolved grief.     - The imagery of the \"evening doorknobs\" and the recurring \"different woman\" reflects the father’s absence and the family’s struggle with his memory.  3. **Context**:     - As noted in **Web Page 3 (Linda's Literary Home)**, the poem is an elegy exploring the father’s moral legacy and the speaker’s complicated relationship with his memory.  This text aligns with the **Current Search Query** and supports further analysis of the poem’s themes and structure."

Since 2016, the BAFTA Games Awards ceremony has coincided with the London Games Festival. A secret ballot cast by the British Academy’s membership, which includes “experienced games industry practitioners from a range of backgrounds in game development and production,” chooses the nominees and winners each year. A variety of sponsored awards are also offered by the BAFTAs, and the winners are typically decided by a public vote. All the “Best Game” winners from the BAFTA Games Awards can be found here… YEAR GAME OF THE YEAR WINNER 2024-2025 Astro Bot 2023-2024 Baldur’s Gate 3 2022-2023 Vampire Survivors 2021-2022 Returnal 2020-2021 Hades 2019-2020 Outer Wilds 2018-2019 God of War 2017-2018 What Remains of Edith Finch 2016-2017 Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End 2015-2016 Fallout 4 2014-2015 Destiny 2013-2014 The Last of Us 2012-2013 Dishonored 2011-2012 Portal 2 2010-2011 Mass Effect 2 2009-2010 Batman: Arkham Asylum 2008-2009 Super Mario Galaxy 2007-2008 BioShock 2006-2007 Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter 2005-2006 NO AWARD GIVEN 2004-2005 Half-Life 2 2003-2004 Call of Duty More information about the BAFTA Games Awards can be found at the British Academy’s official website .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Adélies and emperors nest on Antarctica and feed on broken pack ice; global warming 's effect on the latter may affect their numbers, and the chinstraps and gentoo , which both feed in open waters, have been making inroads into the Adélie and emperors' formerly ice-packed range. The gentoo have thus seen 7500% population growth since 1974, and the chinstraps 2700%.

PMC Copyright notice PMCID: PMC7655846  PMID: 33173126 Abstract Using satellite imagery, drone imagery, and ground counts, we have assembled the first comprehensive global population assessment of Chinstrap penguins ( Pygoscelis antarctica ) at 3.42 (95th-percentile CI: [2.98, 4.00]) million breeding pairs across 375 extant colonies. Twenty-three previously known Chinstrap penguin colonies are found to be absent or extirpated. We identify five new colonies, and 21 additional colonies previously unreported and likely missed by previous surveys. Limited or imprecise historical data prohibit our assessment of population change at 35% of all Chinstrap penguin colonies. Of colonies for which a comparison can be made to historical counts in the 1980s, 45% have probably or certainly declined and 18% have probably or certainly increased. Several large colonies in the South Sandwich Islands, where conditions apparently remain favorable for Chinstrap penguins, cannot be assessed against a historical benchmark. Our population assessment provides a detailed baseline for quantifying future changes in Chinstrap penguin abundance, sheds new light on the environmental drivers of Chinstrap penguin population dynamics in Antarctica, and contributes to ongoing monitoring and conservation efforts at a time of climate change and concerns over declining krill abundance in the Southern Ocean. Subject terms: Ecology, Ocean sciences Introduction Chinstrap penguins ( Pygoscelis antarctica ) are abundant in Antarctica, with past estimates ranging from 3–8 million breeding pairs, and are considered a species of “least concern” by BirdLife International 1 , but the population dynamics of this species are not well understood and several studies have highlighted significant declines at monitored sites 2 – 6 . Because Chinstrap penguins nest in remote and rugged areas, on-the-ground census work is difficult, expensive, and sporadic. As a result, documentation of global Chinstrap penguin abundance and distribution has, to date, been unavoidably incomplete, and many regions where Chinstrap penguins breed have not been visited or surveyed since the early 1980s. Without an accurate count, it is impossible to form a complete picture of the species’ distribution and assess its population dynamics over time. The literature on Chinstrap penguin abundance and population trends suggests that Chinstrap penguin numbers in Antarctica increased during the decades leading up to the 1970s 7 , 8 and subsequently declined. Since the 1980s, breeding populations in some areas have been reported to have declined by > 50% 2 – 6 , 8 , 9 , with notable exceptions in the South Sandwich Islands, at South Georgia Island, and in a few sites near the southern extent of the Chinstrap penguin’s range 4 , 10 . Because of their dependence on krill ( Euphausia spp.) and fish ( Pleuragramma antarctica ), Chinstrap penguins can be viewed as “marine sentinels” for quantifying environmental change in the Southern Ocean 11 . Despite considerable interest in the dynamics of this species as a window into the Southern Ocean ecosystem 12 , reliable population estimates for Chinstrap penguins are lacking, both globally and regionally. Updated counts would improve estimates of krill consumption by Chinstrap penguins and benefit spatial planning efforts, including the design of protected areas. Accurate, longitudinal data are also needed to test hypotheses attempting to explain why both Chinstrap and Adélie ( Pygoscelis adeliae ) penguin populations around the Western Antarctic Peninsula have declined for the past half century while Gentoo penguins ( Pygoscelis papua ) have increased, in many cases at colonies where the species nest side by side (e.g. 8 , 13 , 14 ). Popular hypotheses suggest that penguin populations are driven by krill availability, but krill biomass is broadly affected by climate change, krill fishing, and the recovery of whale and seal populations—the collective effects of which are dif\"\n}\n**Web Page 3:**\n{\n  \"id\": 3,\n  \"title\": \"Penguin - Wikipedia\",\n  \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Satellite images and photos released in 2018 show the population of 2 million in France's remote Ile aux Cochons has collapsed, with barely 200,000 ...\",\n  \"context\": \"o Euskara فارسی Føroyskt Français Frysk Gaeilge Gàidhlig Galego 客家語 / Hak-kâ-ngî 한국어 Hausa Հայերեն हिन्दी Hrvatski Ido Ilokano Bahasa Indonesia Ирон IsiZulu Íslenska Italiano עברית Jawa ಕನ್ನಡ ქართული کٲشُر Kaszëbsczi Қазақша Kernowek Kiswahili Kotava Kurdî Кыргызча Кырык мары ລາວ Latina Latviešu Lëtzebuergesch Lietuvių Limburgs Lingála Lingua Franca Nova Magyar मैथिली Македонски Malagasy മലയാളം मराठी مصرى Bahasa Melayu 閩東語 / Mìng-dĕ̤ng-ngṳ̄ Монгол မြန်မာဘာသာ Nederlands Nedersaksies नेपाली 日本語 Нохчийн Nordfriisk Norsk bokmål Norsk nynorsk Occitan Oromoo Oʻzbekcha / ўзбекча ਪੰਜਾਬੀ پنجابی Plattdüütsch Polski Português Qaraqalpaqsha Română Runa Simi Русский Саха тыла Gagana Samoa Scots Shqip Sicilianu Simple English Slovenčina Slovenščina کوردی Српски / srpski Srpskohrvatski / српскохрватски Sunda Suomi Svenska Tagalog தமிழ் Taqbaylit తెలుగు ไทย Türkçe Українська اردو Vahcuengh Vèneto Tiếng Việt 文言 West-Vlams Winaray 吴语 ייִדיש Yorùbá 粵語 Zeêuws 中文 Edit links Article Talk English Read View source View history Tools Tools move to sidebar hide Actions Read View source View history General What links here Related changes Upload file Permanent link Page information Cite this page Get shortened URL Download QR code Print/export Download as PDF Printable version In other projects Wikimedia Commons Wikispecies Wikinews Wikidata item Appearance move to sidebar hide From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Family of aquatic flightless birds For other uses, see Penguin (disambiguation) .

[ 4 ] They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere . Only one species , the Galápagos penguin , is equatorial, with a small portion of its population extending slightly north of the equator (within a quarter degree of latitude). Highly adapted for life in the ocean water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming. Most penguins feed on krill , fish , squid and other forms of sea life which they catch with their bills and swallow whole while swimming. A penguin has a spiny tongue and powerful jaws to grip slippery prey. [ 5 ] They spend about half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea. The largest living species is the emperor penguin ( Aptenodytes forsteri ): [ 6 ] on average, adults are about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 35 kg (77 lb). The smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin ( Eudyptula minor ), also known as the fairy penguin, which stands around 30–33 cm (12–13 in) tall and weighs 1.2–1.3 kg (2.6–2.9 lb). [ 7 ] Today, larger penguins generally inhabit colder regions, and smaller penguins inhabit regions with temperate or tropical climates . Some prehistoric penguin species were enormous: as tall or heavy as an adult human. [ 8 ] There was a great diversity of species in subantarctic regions, and at least one giant species in a region around 2,000 km south of the equator 35 mya , during the Late Eocene , a climate decidedly warmer than today. [ 9 ] Etymology The name penguin was first used in the late 16th century for the Great Auk (pictured here) and was later applied to Southern Hemisphere birds due to their resemblance, though they are not closely related. [ 10 ] The word penguin first appears in literature at the end of the 16th century as a synonym for the great auk . [ 11 ] When European explorers discovered what are today known as penguins in the Southern Hemisphere, they noticed their similar appearance to the great auk of the Northern Hemisphere and named them after this bird, although they are not closely related. [ 12 ] The etymology of the word penguin is still debated. The English word is not apparently of French , [ 13 ] Breton [ 14 ] or Spanish [ 15 ] origin (the latter two are attributed to the French word pingouin ), but first appears in English or Dutch. [ 13 ] Some dictionaries suggest a derivation from Welsh pen , 'head' and gwyn , 'white', [ 16 ] including the Oxford English Dictionary , the American Heritage Dictionary , [ 17 ] the Century Dictionary [ 17 ] and Merriam-Webster , [ 18 ] on the basis that the name was originally applied to the great auk, either because it was found on White Head Island ( Welsh : Pen Gwyn ) in Newfoundland, or because it had white circles around its eyes (though the head was black). However, the Welsh word pen can also be used to mean 'front' and, in a maritime context, pen blaen means 'front end or part, bow (of a ship), prow'. [ 19 ] An alternative etymology links the word to Latin pinguis , which means 'fat' or 'oil'. [ 20 ] Support for this etymology can be found in the alternative Germanic word for penguin, fettgans or 'fat-goose', and the related Dutch word vetgans . Adult male penguins are sometimes called cocks , females sometimes called hens ; a group of penguins on land is a waddle , and a group of penguins in the water is a raft . Pinguinus Main article: Great auk Since 1871, the Latin word Pinguinus has been used in scientific classification to name the genus of the great auk ( Pinguinus impennis , meaning \\\"plump or fat without flight feathers \\\"), [ 10 ] which became extinct in the mid-19th century.

Clockwise from the left: piping plover , [ 1 ] chinstrap penguins , [ 2 ] Cassia Crossbill , [ 3 ] Carnaby's Black Cockatoo , [ 4 ] Black-tailed godwit , [ 5 ] and Ethiopian Bush-crow . [ 6 ] Significant work has gone into analyzing the effects of climate change on birds . [ 7 ] Like other animal groups, birds are affected by anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change . The research includes tracking the changes in species' life cycles over decades in response to the changing world, [ 8 ] evaluating the role of differing evolutionary pressures [ 9 ] and even comparing museum specimens with modern birds to track changes in appearance and body structure. [ 10 ] Predictions of range shifts caused by the direct and indirect impacts of climate change on bird species are amongst the most important, as they are crucial for informing animal conservation work, required to minimize extinction risk from climate change . [ 11 ] Climate change mitigation options can also have varying impacts on birds. However, even the environmental impact of wind power is estimated to be much less threatening to birds than the continuing effects of climate change . [ 12 ] Causes [ edit ] Further information: Climate change and Effects of climate change Climate change has raised the temperature of the Earth by about 1.1 °C (2.0 °F) since the Industrial Revolution . As the extent of future greenhouse gas emissions and mitigation actions determines the climate change scenario taken, warming may increase from present levels by less than 0.4 °C (0.72 °F) with rapid and comprehensive mitigation (the 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) Paris Agreement goal)  to around 3.5 °C (6.3 °F) (4.5 °C (8.1 °F) from the preindustrial) by the end of the century with very high and continually increasing greenhouse gas emissions. [ 13 ] : 21 Effects [ edit ] Physical changes [ edit ] Museum specimens of Collared flycatcher (top) and Eurasian blackbird (bottom) juveniles compared with modern-day birds. Nesting feathers are replaced with adult plumage earlier, and females now complete the shift earlier than males, while in the past it was the opposite. [ 10 ] Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves , characterized by feathers , toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart , and a strong yet lightweight skeleton . Climate change has already altered the appearance of some birds by facilitating changes to their feathers . A comparison of museum specimens of juvenile passerines from 1800s with juveniles of the same species today had shown that these birds now complete the switch from their nesting feathers to adult feathers earlier in their lifecycle, and that females now do this earlier than males. [ 10 ] Further, blue tits are defined by blue and yellow feathers, but a study in Mediterranean France had shown that those contrasting colors became less bright and intense in just the period between 2005 and 2019. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] A study in Chicago showed that the length of birds' lower leg bones (an indicator of body sizes) shortened by an average of 2.4% and their wings lengthened by 1.3%. In the central Amazon area, birds have decreased in mass (an indicator of size) by up to 2% per decade, and increased in wing length by up to 1% per decade, with links to temperature and precipitation shifts. These morphological trends may demonstrate an example of evolutionary change following Bergmann's rule . [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] Across Eurasia , snowfinches became both smaller and darker over the past 100 years. [ 20 ] Rising temperatures due to global warming have also been shown to decrease the size of many migratory birds. [ 21 ] In a first study to identify a direct link between cognition and phenotypic responses to climate change , researchers show that size reduction is much more pronounced in smaller-brained birds compared to bigger-brained species. [ 21 ] Reduction in body size is a general response to warming temperatures since birds with smaller bodies can dissipate heat easier, helping to cope with the heat-caused stress. Reduced body and brain sizes also lead to reduced cognitive and competitive ability, making the smaller-species birds easier targets for predators. [ 21 ] In another study where researchers compared the brain sizes of 1,176 bird species, they found that species that spend more resources on their young have larger brains as adults. [ 22 ] Bird species that feed their offspring after hatching have extended durations during which their young can develop their brain, producing more intelligent and larger-brained offspring.

They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere: only one species, the Galápagos penguin, is found north of the Equator. Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they catch with their bills and swallow it whole while swimming. A penguin has a spiny tongue and powerful jaws to grip slippery prey. They spend roughly half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea. The largest living species is the Emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri): on average, adults are about 1.1 m tall and weigh 35 kg. The smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin (Eudyptula minor), also known as the fairy penguin, which stands around 33 cm tall and weighs 1 kg. Today, larger penguins generally inhabit colder regions, and smaller penguins inhabit regions with temperate or tropical climates. Some prehistoric penguin species were enormous: as tall or heavy as an adult human. There was a great diversity of species in subantarctic regions, and at least one giant species in a region around 2,000 km south of the equator 35 mya, in a climate decidedly warmer than today. Anatomy and physiology Penguin wings have the same general bone structure as flighted birds, but the bones are shorter and stouter to allow them to serve as fins. 1). Humerus 2). Sesamoid Bone 3). Radius 4). Ulna 5). Radial Carpal bone 6). Carpometacarpus 7). Phalanges Taxidermized penguin skin Penguins are superbly adapted to aquatic life. Their wings have evolved to become flippers, useless for flight in the air. In the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. Penguins' swimming looks very similar to birds' flight in the air. Within the smooth plumage a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold waters. On land, penguins use their tails and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance. All penguins are countershaded for camouflage – that is, they have black backs and wings with white fronts. A predator looking up from below (such as an orca or a leopard seal) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the reflective water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above. Gentoo penguins are the fastest underwater birds in the world. They are capable of reaching speeds up to 36 km (about 22 miles) per hour while searching for food or escaping from predators. They are also able to dive to depths of 170–200 meters (about 560–660 feet). The small penguins do not usually dive deep; they catch their prey near the surface in dives that normally last only one or two minutes. Larger penguins can dive deep in case of need. Emperor penguins are the world’s deepest-diving birds. They can dive to depths of approximately 550 meters (1,800 feet) while searching for food. Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow while using their feet to propel and steer themselves, a movement called \\\"tobogganing\\\", which conserves energy while moving quickly. They also jump with both feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain. Penguins have an average sense of hearing for birds; this is used by parents and chicks to locate one another in crowded colonies. Their eyes are adapted for underwater vision and are their primary means of locating prey and avoiding predators; in air it has been suggested that they are n\"\n}\n"

        "Steps": "1. Searched \"WoW classes\" on Google.\n2. Opened \"https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/game/classes\".\n3. Made an alphabetical list of all WoW classes: Death Knight, Demon Hunter, Druid, Evoker, Hunter, Mage, Monk, Paladin, Priest, Rogue, Shaman, Warlock, and Warrior.\n4. Opened each page and noted the armor type: Death Knight (plate), Demon Hunter (leather), Druid (leather), Evoker (mail), Hunter (mail), Mage (cloth), Monk (leather), Paladin (plate), Priest (cloth), Rogue (leather), Shaman (mail), Warlock (cloth), and Warrior (plate).\n5. Looked up \"Kilt of the Forgotten One\" on Google.\n6. Opened https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/item=37616/kilt-of-the-forgotten-one.\n7. Noted that it is leather, and none of the classes can use it, so the remaining classes are: Death Knight (plate), Evoker (mail), Hunter (mail), Mage (cloth), Paladin (plate), Priest (cloth), Shaman (mail), Warlock (cloth), and Warrior (plate).\n8. Noted that it was added in Wrath of the Lich King, so if the dungeon is newly released, the era is the Wrath of the Lich King expansion.\n9. Searched \"Wrath of the Lich King class abilities\" on Google.\n10. Opened https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/spells/abilities.\n11. Sorted by class and noted that Evokers, Demon Hunters, and Monks did not exist yet, so the remaining classes are: Death Knight (plate), Hunter (mail), Mage (cloth), Paladin (plate), Priest (cloth), Shaman (mail), Warlock (cloth), and Warrior (plate).\n12. Checked which classes use Holy school abilities, Paladin (plate) and Priest (cloth), so they must be in the group as tank and healer.\n13. Checked which classes use ice (Frost) and fire abilities, Death Knight (plate), Mage (cloth), Shaman (mail), and Warlock (cloth).\n14. There can only be one other plate class, so it must be Death Knight or Warrior, and one other cloth class, so it must be Mage or Warlock.\n15. Metamorphosis is a Warlock ability in Wrath of the Lich King, so it must be the other cloth class, and the group so far is Paladin, Priest, Warlock, plate DPS, and other DPS, with remaining options of Death Knight (plate), Hunter (mail), Mage (cloth), Shaman (mail), and Warrior (plate).\n16. There cannot be another cloth class, so the remaining options are Death Knight (plate), Hunter (mail), Shaman (mail), and Warrior (plate).\n17. There is a bear attacking the boss and there is no Druid to shapeshift into a bear, so it must be a Hunter's pet, making the group Paladin, Priest, Warlock, Hunter, and plate DPS, with remaining options of Death Knight (plate), Hunter (mail), Mage (cloth), Shaman (mail), and Warrior (plate).\n18. The last class is plate, leaving only Death Knight and Warrior.\n19. Hunters and Warlocks can both cast Fire abilities but cannot cast Frost abilities, so the last DPS must cast ice (Frost) abilities, making the last DPS a Frost Death Knight since Warriors have no Frost abilities.\n20. Order the group alphabetically: Death Knight, Hunter, Paladin, Priest, Warlock.",

Two are plate wearers and two are cloth wearers. At the final boss, both the tank and the healer are casting holy spells. Ice and fire are being used, each one by a different DPS. A bear from the group is attacking the boss. Metamorphosis is cast. The Kilt of the Forgotten One drops as loot, but no one can use it. If all classes were using their class abilities and all classes are unique, what are the five classes in the group in alphabetical order separated by commas?\n\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nTo solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the roles and their attire:**\n   - Tank: One plate wearer\n   - Healer: One plate wearer (casting holy spells)\n   - DPS: Two cloth wearers (one using ice, one using fire)\n   - Bear: One of the DPS is a bear, which is a form of the Druid class\n\n2. **Identify the classes:**\n   - The tank and healer are both plate wearers. In World of Warcraft, the classes that wear plate armor are Warrior, Paladin, and Death Knight.\n   - The DPS are cloth wearers. The classes that wear cloth armor are Mage, Warlock, and Rogue.\n   - The bear form indicates that one of the DPS is a Druid.\n\n3. **Determine the unique classes:**\n   - Since all classes are unique, we need to assign each role to a unique class.\n   - The healer is casting holy spells, which can be done by a Paladin or a Priest.\n   - The tank is also a plate wearer, so it could be a Warrior, Paladin, or Death Knight.\n   - The DPS are using ice and fire, which can be done by a Mage or a Warlock.\n   - The bear form indicates a Druid.\n\n4. **Assign the classes:**\n   - Since the healer is casting holy spells, it must be a Paladin.\n   - The tank could be a Warrior, Paladin, or Death Knight. Since we already have a Paladin for the healer, it must be a Warrior or a Death Knight. Let's assume it's a Warrior for now.\n   - The DPS are using ice and fire. A Mage can use ice, and a Warlock can use fire. A Druid can also use both ice and fire in different forms ( Frost and Fire).\n   - The bear form indicates a Druid. So, one of the DPS is a Druid.\n   - The remaining DPS is a Warlock (since the Druid is already used and we need unique classes).\n\n5. **Check the classes and roles:**\n   - Tank: Warrior (plate)\n   - Healer: Paladin (plate)\n   - DPS 1: Druid (bear form, cloth)\n   - DPS 2: Warlock (cloth)\n   - DPS 3: Mage (cloth)\n\n6. **Alphabetical order:**\n   - Druid, Mage, Paladin, Warlock, Warrior\n\nTherefore, the five classes in the group in alphabetical order separated by commas are:\n\n\\boxed{Druid,Mage,Paladin,Warlock,Warrior}",

Abstract : Inverse problems are paramount in Science and Engineering. In this paper, we consider the setup of Statistical Inverse Problem (SIP) and demonstrate how Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithms can be used to solve linear SIP. We provide consistency and finite sample bounds for the excess risk. We also propose a modification for the SGD algorithm where we leverage machine learning methods to smooth the stochastic gradients and improve empirical performance. We exemplify the algorithm in a setting of great interest nowadays: the Functional Linear Regression model. In this case we consider a synthetic data example and a classification problem for predicting the main activity of bitcoin addresses based on their balances.

Abstract : Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention.\\n  In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence.\\n  We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing.\\n  Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.

As soon as you are notified of papers to review, you are expected to log in to OpenReview to check for conflicts and to check that papers fall within your area of expertise. If you don’t feel qualified to review a paper that was assigned to you, please communicate this to your AC right away. These assignments may change during the first week, as some reviewers and ACs request re-assignments. Please watch for notification email from Openreview. Write thoughtful reviews: Monday, June 13, 2022 – Monday, July 11, 2022. We know that serving as a reviewer for NeurIPS is time consuming, but the community depends on your high quality reviews to uphold the scientific quality of NeurIPS. Please make your review as informative and substantiated as possible; superficial, uninformed reviews are worse than no review as they may contribute noise to the review process. You can see the review form questions and guidance on how to answer each question in the \\\"Review Form\\\" section below. Make sure to flag any questionable papers for ethics review. These papers will be assigned ethics reviewers, who will effectively join the paper's assigned program committee. See the NeurIPS ethics guidelines . Feel free to use the NeurIPS paper checklist included in each paper as a tool when preparing your review (some submissions may have the checklist as part of the supplementary materials) . Remember that answering “no” to some questions is typically not grounds for rejection. In general, authors should be rewarded rather than punished for being up front about the limitations of their work and any potential negative societal impact. You are encouraged to think through whether any critical points are missing and provide these as feedback for the authors. Do not worry about minor violations of the required format (e.g., papers that exceed the page limit by a few lines), but immediately report any major violations that you notice to your AC. When writing your review, please keep in mind that after decisions have been made, reviews and meta-reviews of accepted papers as well as your discussion with the authors will be made public (but reviewer and SAC/AC identities will remain anonymous). This year, authors of rejected papers will have the option to make this information public for their rejected papers as well. Please note that the review form this year asks for some additional fields such as text fields for the strengths and weaknesses, and questions and suggestions for authors. There are also additional ratings on soundness, presentation and contribution, in addition to the overall rating. These are intended to make it easier for the AC and SAC to understand your rationale for the rating, and facilitate better discussions. Read author responses and discuss papers: Tuesday, August 2 – Thursday, August 26, 2022. Authors will be given one week to respond to their reviews before the discussion period, then the 3-phase discussions will begin. Author-Reviewer Discussions (Aug 2 - Aug 9): During this first phase, please carefully read all other reviews and the author responses to all reviews for the papers assigned to you. Then please engage in an open exchange with the authors. Reviewer-AC Discussions (Aug 10 - Aug 19): During this second phase, please discuss the paper, the reviews, and the author responses among the reviewers and with the area chair. Metareview Discussions (Aug 20 - Aug 26): During this last phase, the area chairs will be writing their metareviews and eliciting further comments and clarifications from the reviewers. Please help your AC in their metareview writing. As you read each author response, please keep an open mind. Even if the author response didn’t change your opinion about the paper, please acknowledge that you have read and considered it. Participating in discussions is a critical part of your role as a reviewer.  The discussion period is especially important for borderline papers and papers for which the reviewers’ assessments differ, and we hope that you take discussions seriously.  If your evaluation of the paper has changed, please revise your review and explain the change.

Modeling the behaviors, goals, or beliefs of opponents could help the agent adjust its policy to adapt to different opponents. In addition, it is also important to consider opponents who are learning simultaneously or capable of reasoning. However, existing work usually tackles only one of the aforementioned types of opponents. In this paper, we propose model-based opponent modeling (MBOM), which employs the environment model to adapt to all kinds of opponents. MBOM simulates the recursive reasoning process in the environment model and imagines a set of improving opponent policies. To effectively and accurately represent the opponent policy, MBOM further mixes the imagined opponent policies according to the similarity with the real behaviors of opponents. Empirically, we show that MBOM achieves more effective adaptation than existing methods in a variety of tasks, respectively with different types of opponents, i.e., fixed policy, naive learner, and reasoning learner.

As a result, they often fail to capture the complexity, disagreement, and subtle reasoning that characterize authentic human judgment (Kahneman et al., 2021 ; Wang et al., 2023 ; Liu et al., 2024a , b ) . At the same time, the powerful capabilities of LLMs are beginning to reshape scientific workflows themselves (Karabacak and Margetis, 2023 ; Ganjavi et al., 2024 ; Elsevier, 2023 ; Van Dis et al., 2023 ; Fecher et al., 2025 ) . Tools based on LLMs such as ChatGPT are making research communication, including literature reviews and even paper writing, more accessible (Taylor et al., 2022 ; Else, 2023 ; Si et al., 2024 ; Wang et al., 2024a ) , hence accelerating scientific output and contributing to a significant rise in the volume of submissions to top conferences. Such a transformation has intensified pressure on the peer review system (Horbach, 2019 ; Allen-Zhu and Xu, 2025 ) .\\nConferences now receive more than 10 thousands of submissions per cycle, and the human effort required to maintain high-quality, fair, and constructive reviewing has become difficult to sustain. Given such high pressure, the need for scalable assistance tools, better evaluation data, and models that can understand or generate scholarly critique has grown (Allen-Zhu and Xu, 2025 ; Chiang and Lee, 2023 ; Kumar et al., 2024 ) . However, large-scale, systematic exploration regarding both the datasets and methodologies that enable LLMs to capture the richness of peer review interactions is still missing (Liu and Shah, 2023 ; Zhou et al., 2024 ; Thakkar et al., 2025 ) . OpenReview 1 1 1 https://openreview.net/ (Soergel, 2013 ) , the public review platform widely used by conferences such as ICLR, NeurIPS, and others, offers a unique opportunity to meet the needs of both sides. Contributed by the community and continually expanding over time, OpenReview hosts large-scale, structured records of scientific discussion, typically including paper submissions, reviewer assessments, author rebuttals, meta-reviews, and final decisions. These interactions span multiple rounds and involve diverse expert perspectives, making OpenReview an invaluable living dataset grounded in real-world scientific research deliberation. And has the potential to enrich both data-centric LLM research and assist the peer review system. Figure 1: Left : an overview of the OpenReview data generation process; mid : this position paper argues OpenReview supports three main valuable applications — regulating peer review, empowering LLM and Agentic open-ended task research, and post-training for alignment and reasoning; right : highlighted research opportunities around those use cases. This position paper argues that OpenReview should be leveraged more broadly as a core community asset for advancing research in the era of LLMs. We elaborate on three areas where this dataset can provide immediate value: 1. A data-driven approach to improve the quality and scalability of peer review. OpenReview provides a unique source of structured, expert-generated assessments that can be used to train machine learning models to analyze and support the peer review process. Machine learning models, including the state-of-the-art general purpose language models (Google DeepMind, 2025 ; OpenAI, 2025 ; Anthropic, 2024 ; xAI, 2025 ) , may learn to assist reviewers in\\ndrafting constructive feedback, calibrating scores, and identifying argumentative gaps, as well as summarizing responses, checking code, or detecting unhelpful language.\\nIn the face of rising submission volumes and reviewer fatigue, such tools could support more consistent, fair, and informative evaluations.

Unlike diffusion models that require hundreds of denoising steps, ENAT needs only 4–8 steps; unlike autoregressive transformers that generate tokens sequentially, ENAT predicts multiple (masked) tokens simultaneously. This architectural redesign of non-autoregressive generation significantly improves efficiency over traditional NATs that process all tokens uniformly.

This is achieved by adapting proven fusion techniques from vision-language modelling (e.g. ViT) to the RAG context. Traditional RAG systems rely primarily on similarity-based retrieval that may not capture the complex ways information should be integrated into the LLM’s reasoning process. In contrast, xRAG can learn a more sophisticated fusion mechanism through its modality projector and the cross-attention between query embedding (Q) and projected documents embedding (K).

Authors are not resopnsible for responding to any late reviews, and the area chairs will ensure fair judgement given the delay in the reviews. Will the rebuttals be shown to the reviewers/ACs immediately? Yes, the rebuttals will be revealed to the reviewers/ACs as soon as they are uploaded. Can we upload a revision of our paper? Until when? Yes, you may revise your paper (same 9-page limit applies) until the end of the Reviewer-Author discussion period which ends on Aug 9. However, please note that the reviewers are not obligated to read the revised paper. What is the page limit for the revision during the rebuttal/discussion? Please stick to the 9-page limit during the review process. The extra page applies only to the accepted papers for the camera-ready. Can we upload a revision of the supplementary materials? Yes, please ensure that anything in your revised supplementary materials must also be properly anonymized. Can the revision include new results? Yes, but again, reviewers do not have to read the revision. Your original submission will serve as the basis for the reviewers' (and ACs') acceptance recommendations. The revisions should serve to clarify the reviewers' and ACs' questions during the discussion period. Can we include an anonymous link in the author rebuttal? Yes, but please make sure anything, including the URL, github id, comments in the code, do not reveal author identity or the institution. Is there a length limit for the author rebuttal? No, the OpenReview platform has a length limit on each comment, but you can use multiple comments. We strongly advise you to be concise in your responses. Reviewers posted last-minute questions, and the reviewer-author discussion has closed. What do we do? Area chairs are fully aware that authors cannot respond to last-minute questions, so they will take that into account. We cannot extend the author-reviewer discussion period, as many authors, reviewers, and ACs have planned their work according to our schedule, and extensions would cause delay and additional burden for all involved. Submission process Can the author list be changed? Changes may be made to the author list until the full paper deadline. After that, authors may be reordered if/when your paper is accepted, but any additions or removals must be justified in writing and approved on a case-by-case basis by the program chairs. After the full paper deadline, how should we request author changes? During the review process (reviewing, rebuttal, discussions), author list changes cannot be made. If/when your paper is accepted, please email the program chairs with all of the authors cc'd. Do my co-authors need to create an OpenReview account? Yes. Before the full paper deadline, every co-author needs to create (or update) an OpenReview profile. The information entered in the profile is used for conflict resolution, as discussed in this document . I missed the abstract submission deadline. Can I still submit a full paper? No. The abstract submission deadline is firm. Can I submit supplementary material after the deadline? Yes. The deadline for supplementary material (including appendix and source code) is one week after the paper deadline. Check the call for papers for the exact day and time. Can I withdraw my submission? Yes. You can withdraw your submission at any point in the reviewing process. Submission format and content Can I include appendices in my main submission file? Yes. You can include appendices with the main submission file, or you can include them as a separate file in the supplementary materials. I would like to write my paper using Microsoft Word, but I don’t see a template. Can you provide one? No. The Microsoft Word template has been discontinued. Authors must use the NeurIPS 2022 LaTeX style file. Is there guidance for filling out the NeurIPS paper checklist? Yes! See this document, which is linked from the CFP: https://neurips.cc/public/guides/PaperChecklist .  You may also be interested in the blog post from 2021 which explains the motivation behind the checklist and how it was created. Is a broader impact statement required and must it fit within the page limit? You are not required to include a section titled broader impacts in your paper. However, you should still consider any potential negative societal impacts of your work. You may include a discussion of these potential negative societal impacts anywhere in the paper (in the intro, in the conclusion, as a stand-alone section, in the supplemental material if appropriate, etc.), but this discussion may not exceed the page limit. See the checklist guidance and blog post for more information. What material is allowed beyond the nine-page limit? The main body of your paper must be contained in the first nine pages of your submission. References and the paper checklist, and the (optional) appendix are not included in this page limit. You may also include an appendix in a separate document as part of your supplemental material. What is the policy on comparisons to recent work? Papers appearing less than two months before the submission deadline are generally considered concurrent to NeurIPS submissions.  Authors are not expected to compare to work that appeared only a month or two before the deadline. Are arxiv papers also subject to the policy above? Yes, we do not distinguish arxiv papers and other published (conference & journal) papers, and the two-month rule applies in the same way. More nuanced judgements, including how to determine the date of publication, should be made by the area chair handling the submission. Dual submissions Can I submit work to NeurIPS that is currently in submission to another archival venue? The NeurIPS policy on dual submissions explicitly prohibits this.

Abstract : Objective-space decomposition algorithms (ODAs) are widely studied for solving multi-objective integer programs. However, they often encounter difficulties in handling scalarized problems, which could cause infeasibility or repetitive nondominated points and thus induce redundant runtime. To mitigate the issue, we present a graph neural network (GNN) based method to learn the reduction rule in the ODA. We formulate the algorithmic procedure of generic ODAs as a Markov decision process, and parameterize the policy (reduction rule) with a novel two-stage GNN to fuse information from variables, constraints and especially objectives for better state representation. We train our model with imitation learning and deploy it on a state-of-the-art ODA. Results show that our method significantly improves the solving efficiency of the ODA. The learned policy generalizes fairly well to larger problems or more objectives, and the proposed GNN outperforms existing ones for integer programming in terms of test and generalization accuracy.

Tables 12011 POPULATION CENSUS – MAIN RESULTS Population • As of 1.02.2011 the population of Bulgaria is 7 364 570 persons. 3 777 999 persons (51.3%) are women and 3 586 571 persons (48.7%) are men, or 1 000 men accounted for 1 053 women. • The tendency for urbanization is kept - 5 339 001 persons live in urban areas or 72.5% and 2 025 569 persons live in rural areas or 27.5% of the population in the country. • Within the period between the two censuses 2001 and 2011 the country population decreased with 564 331 persons and the average annual rate of decrease is 0.7%. • Two thirds of the decrease is due to the negative natural increase (more dead than born persons) and one third (31.1%) to the international migration, which is estimated at 175 244 persons. Territorial distribution • The biggest district as regards the number of population is Sofia capital, where 1 291 591 persons live or 17.5% of the population in the country. The smallest district is Vidin - 101 018 persons (1.4%). • In the period between the two censuses only the population in Sofia capital has increased by 120 749 persons or 10,3% and Varna – by 13 061 persons or 2,8%. • There are considerable differences in the number of population by municipalities - 39.2% of the population in the country lives in 9 municipalities with population over 100 000 persons. In 60 municipalities the enumerated persons are below 6 000 and 3.1% of the country population lives there. • The population in the country is distributed in 255 cities and 5 047 villages. In 181 settlements there are no enumerated persons. From 1 to 50 persons live in one fifth (21%) of the settlements, while between 100 and 500 persons live in little more than a third (36%) from the settlements. • One third of the population in the country (33.6%) lives in the seven biggest cities, where the population is over 100 000 persons. Structure by age • The process of demographic aging continues. It is expressed by reducing the absolute number and relative share of the population less than 15 years and increasing the share of population aged 65 years and older. The share of population over 65 increased from 16.8% in 2001 to 18.5% in 2011. At the same time in 2001 persons under 15 years are 15.3% of the population in the country. In 2011 their share decreases to 13.2%. • The population aged 65 years and more has the biggest relative share in the following districts: Vidin - 25.5%, Montana and Gabrovo - 24%, Lovech - 23.3%, and Kyustendil - 22.8%. The share of adult population is lowest in districts Blagoevgrad, Varna and Sofia - capital – 16%. • 62.2% of the population in the country is at working age, i.e. 4 576 904 persons. 52.5% of them are men and 47.5%\"\n}\n**Web Page 2:**\n{\n  \"id\": 2,\n  \"title\": \"[PDF] 2011 population census in the republic of bulgaria - Data Catalog\",\n  \"url\":

Source: Eurostat (online data code: educ_uoe_grad04) This article presents statistics on tertiary education (levels 5 to 8 of the International Standard Classification of Education – ISCED ) in the European Union (EU) and forms part of an online publication on education and training in the EU. Tertiary education – provided by universities and other tertiary educational institutions – typically follows secondary schooling. It is considered to play an essential role in society, by fostering innovation, driving economic development and growth, and more generally improving the well-being of the population. Some European universities are among the most prestigious in the world. Many commentators predict increased demand for highly skilled people in the future. Driven by digital technology, jobs are becoming more flexible and complex. As a result, a growing number of employers seek staff with the necessary capacities to manage complex information, think autonomously, be creative, use resources efficiently and communicate effectively. A relatively large number of students in tertiary education are internationally mobile and study abroad: an analysis of this phenomenon is available in a separate article . Participation by level Table 1: Number of tertiary education students by sex and level of education, 2023 Source: Eurostat (educ_uoe_enrt01) Table 1 presents data on the number of students in each of 4 levels of tertiary education . Bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral levels of tertiary education are found in all EU countries, while short-cycle tertiary education, which is typically vocational (occupationally specific) and designed to prepare students for the labour market, is not part of the education system in Bulgaria, Estonia, Greece, Romania or Finland. Short-cycle tertiary education is also quite uncommon – accounting for less than 1.0% of the total number of tertiary students – in several other EU countries, namely Czechia, Germany, Croatia, Lithuania and Poland. In the EU , there were 18.8 million tertiary education students in 2023 (see Table 1). Germany – the most populous country in the EU – had 3.3 million tertiary education students, which was the highest number in the EU and equivalent to 17.7% of the EU total. France (15.2% of the total), Spain (12.6%) and Italy (11.8%)\"\n}\n**Web Page 7:**\n{\n  \"id\": 7,\n  \"title\": \"Census 2021: Every fourth person in Bulgaria is a university graduate\",\n  \"url\": \"https://sofiaglobe.com/2022/11/16/census-2021-every-fourth-person-in-bulgaria-is-a-university-graduate/\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"The 2021 census found that 29.3 per cent of women in Bulgaria were university graduates, an increase of seven percentage points compared with ...\",\n  \"context\": \"Census 2021: Every fourth person in Bulgaria is a university graduate – The Sofia Globe Skip to content The Sofia Globe Bulgaria’s independent English-language news and features website.

The census found that capital city Sofia had the highest share of university graduates, 43.6 per cent, while the district with the lowest figure was Razgrad, 15.7 per cent. At the other end of the scale, the 2021 census found that 1.3 per cent of Bulgaria’s population was illiterate, a decrease of 0.4 percentage points compared with 2011. About 2.3 per cent of Bulgaria’s rural population was illiterate, compared with 0.9 per cent in urban areas. The district of Sliven had the highest relative share of illiterate people, five per cent, while illiteracy was lowest in capital city Sofia, 0.4 per cent, the NSI said.

PMC Copyright notice PMCID: PMC11401782  PMID: 39276224 Abstract Background: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a gastric Gram-negative, spiral-shaped microaerophilic pathogen. H. pylori may play a potential pathogenic role in extra-intestinal diseases such as hepatobiliary, respiratory, and dermatological disorders. The latter included chronic urticaria, psoriasis and rosacea. The first report in literature on the relationship between H. pylori and acne vulgaris (AV), found association between severe AV and H. pylori infection. There are very limited data in AV patients addressing the impact of H. pylori infection on various severities. In this context, the aim of the present work was to determine the association of H. Pylori infection among AV patients and correlate it with the disease severity. Methods: This case-control study included 45 Patients with AV and 45 age and sex matched healthy volunteers as a control group. H. pylori antigen in stool and serum H. pylori antibody IgG using commercially available ELISA kits was tested in all included subjects. Results: The percentage of participants with a positive H. pylori antigen in stool and positive H. pylori antibody in serum in the whole study population was 35/90 (38. 9%) and 41/90 (45. 6%). On comparing between the percentages of positive H. pylori antigen in stool and positive H. pylori antibody in serum between the patients with AV and healthy controls, a highly statistically significant difference was found between the two groups ( P < 0.001, P = 0.006). On comparing between the percentages of positive H. pylori antigen in stool and positive H. pylori antibody in serum in the patients with different grades of acne severity and healthy controls, the rate of positive H. pylori antigen in stool and positive H. pylori Ab in serum was significantly associated with severity of acne comparing with healthy controls ( p < 0. 001). Conclusion: The rate of H. pylori infection in patients with AV is high so it may influence the pathogenesis of this skin disease. Patients with severe AV had higher rates of H. pylori antigen in stool and H. pylori antibody in serum as compared to the patients with mild AV and healthy controls. Keywords: Helicobacter-pylori-acne-vulgaris-relationship Introduction Acne vulgaris (AV), is one of the most common dermatologic complaints [ 1 ]. About 85% of adolescent population and 3% of the adults between the age of 35–44 years have this disease worldwide [ 2 ]. It is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the pilosebaceous unit. The pathogenesis of AV includes disturbed sebaceous gland activity associated with hyperseborrhoea and alterations in sebum fatty acid composition, dysregulation of the hormone microenvironment, interaction with neuropeptides, follicular hyperkeratinization, Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), induction of inflammation and dysfunction of the innate and adaptive immunity [ 3 ]. Acne can be manifested in both inflammatory and noninflammatory forms [ 4 ]. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a gastric Gram-negative, spiral-shaped microaerophilic pathogen closely associated with gastric and extra-gastric diseases [ 5 , 6 ]. Appropriately half of the global population is infected with H. pylori, and the prevalence of H. pylori varied among regions, which appeared to be explained by the differences in economic and social conditions [ 7 ]. The most common routes of H. pylori transmission are oral-to-oral and fecal-to-oral routes. The colonization of H. pylori itself does not cause an\"\n}\n**Web Page 3:**\n{\n  \"id\": 3,\n  \"title\": \"5 Clinical Trial Record: H. pylori acne enrollment Jan-May 2018 - Exa\",\n  \"url\": \"https://websets.exa.ai/cm8u8bibg01f2fz0ixet4rmfh\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Clinical trial related to H. pylori in acne vulgaris patients.

This achievement marks an important milestone in our journey toward building more capable and practical AI systems. GAIA players Humans achieve about 92% accuracy on the GAIA questions, some being quite challenging.  AI labs have submitted to the GAIA benchmark, including with Magentic-1 by Microsoft, Langfun Agent by Google, Hugging Face Agents, and many others related to research on agents by Princeton et al. GPT-4 with relevant tools achieves about 15%, Hugging Face Agent achieves 33%, Microsoft Research achieves 38% using the OpenAI o1 model or 32% with GPT-4o, while Tianqiao & Chrissy Chen Institute using o1-preview with omne achieves 41%.  Lately, Google’s Langfun Agent achieved 49%. Enterprise h2oGPTe Agent achieves 65%, a substantial leap. Understanding GAIA: Benchmark for Real-World AI Capability GAIA was created by Meta-FAIR, Meta-GenAI, HuggingFace, and AutoGPT teams to stress the limits of LLMs, which at the time (about a year ago) the co-author Yann LeCun noted that “current auto-regressive LLMs don't do very well.”  The GAIA benchmark stands apart from other AI benchmarks by focusing on real-world tasks that require a combination of reasoning, multi-modality handling, and tool use proficiency. Unlike narrower benchmarks such as the ARC Prize ( https://arcprize.org/arc , which focuses primarily on abstract visual pattern recognition), GAIA evaluates AI on their ability to handle practical tasks that businesses actually need. The benchmark includes 466 carefully crafted questions across three difficulty levels, testing: Web browsing and information synthesis Multi-modal understanding (text, images, audio) Code execution and data analysis File handling across various formats Complex reasoning and planning GAIA evaluates how well AI systems help users accomplish real tasks - from data analysis to document processing to complex research questions.  These questions tend to be more challenging than can be answered by standard “code interpreter” tools by OpenAI and others. Example questions: Level 1: What was the actual enrollment count of the clinical trial on H. pylori in acne vulgaris patients from Jan-May 2018 as listed on the NIH website? Level 2: According to https://www.bls.gov/cps/ , what was the difference in unemployment (in %) in the US in june 2009 between 20 years and over men and 20 years and over women? Level 3: In July 2, 1959 United States standards for grades of processed fruits, vegetables, and certain other products listed as dehydrated, consider the items in the 'dried and dehydrated section' specifically marked as dehydrated along with any items in the Frozen/Chilled section that contain the whole name of the item, but not if they're marked Chilled. As of August 2023, what is the percentage (to the nearest percent) of those standards that have been superseded by a new version since the date given in the 1959 standards? Answering level 1 questions requires about 5 steps for a human and up to 1 tool, but can challenge AI visual acuity.  Level 2 questions require 5-10 human steps and any tools, while level 3 questions require humans up to 50 steps and any number of tools. Why GAIA Matters for Business The business implications of GAIA performance are substantial.

PMC Copyright notice PMCID: PMC6042414  PMID: 29996790 Abstract Background Rosacea is an inflammatory disease affecting the central part of face characterized by persistent or recurrent episodes of erythema, papules, pustules and telangiectasias of unknown etiology. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a gram-negative bacillus, which is one of the main causes of chronic gastritis, gastric cancer and gastrointestinal ulcers. Recent evidences have suggested that H. pylori infection is closely related to the occurrence of diseases . In recent years, studies have found that Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with the occurrence of acne rosacea. So the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection may be a therapeutic method of acne rosacea. But it continues to be controversial. In other studies, the treatment of Helicobacter pylori did not significantly reduce the severity of acne rosacea. To further explore the association between acne rosacea and Helicobacter pylori infection, a summarize method was used to study the relationship between acne rosacea and Helicobacter pylori, providing reference for clinical acne rosacea therapy. Methods Systematic searches were conducted on Wanfang Data, CQVIP, Springer, Public Health Management Corporation (PHMC), CNKI, and Pubmed, from January 1,2008 to Mar. 1, 2018, using Helicobacter pylori and rosacea to retrieve the literature. Depending on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 27 articles considered or confirmed the correlation between H. pylori and rosacea. Results Epidemiological investigations and experiments have confirmed that H. pylori infection is associated with the development of rosacea. The effect of anti- H. pylori therapy is better than the routine therapy for rosacea. H. pylori can stimulate the immune system to produce a large number of inflammatory mediators, leading to the occurrence and aggravation of rosacea inflammation. Conclusions It is confirmed that H. pylori infection is involved in the development of rosacea. It is suggested that rosacea patients should be tested for H. pylori infection, the H. pylori -positive rosacea patients should be treated with eradication of H. pylori , so as to enhance the therapeutic effect of rosacea . This study adds that H. pylori infection is involved in the development of rosacea. Epidemiological investigations and experiments have confirmed the rationality. The effect of anti- H. pylori therapy is better than the routine therapy for rosacea. H. pylori- positive rosacea patients should be treated with the therapeutic method of eradication of H. pylori. Keywords: Rosacea, Helicobacter pylori , Related, Correlation, Epidemiological investigation, Experiment, Anti- H. pylori therapy, Mechanism Background Rosacea is an inflammatory disease of unknown etiology, the role of H. pylori infection factor in the pathogenesis of rosacea has been paying close attention to epidemiological, experimental and clinical aspects of H. pylori, which has been confirmed that H. pylori infection is associated with the development of rosacea. But the data are limited, and further clinical and laboratory researches are required to assess the actual existence and relevance of many purported associations. That’s already known about this topic which rosacea is an inflammatory disease affecting the central part of face of unknown etiology, affecting 12.3% Russians and 5.0% Germans and 2.0% ~ 2.3% Americans. As a gram-negative bacillus, H. pylori infection is closely related to the occurrence of diseases. This study adds that H. pylori infection is involved in the development of rosacea.

A short note on some of the reasons we decided to go with openly-sharing the questions instead of holding them back (which was another option we contemplated):\\n- with closed-models we need to send the questions through an external AI anyway so a full privacy of the test set is not possible in general unless the leaderboard is restricted to open models (would be quite restrictive)\\n- also, the benchmark contain a limited number of questions which are non-obvious and take a significant time for human reviewers to solve. We thus don't expect the dataset to become training material for models and to lead to having model over-fitting on the benchmark pattern in the traditional sense that happened with larger benchmark datasets including a training split. This benchmark is generally closer in philosophy to small, hand crafted benchmark datasets, like HumanEval for instance has been for code models. andsoitis on Nov 23, 2023 | prev | next [–] > We release our questions while retaining answers to 300 of them to power a leader-board available at this https URL.

Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection is also a world heath problem, and recent evidence suggests that two conditions may be related. However, there is insignificant evidence to support a casual association of HP infection and acne vulgaris. Aim: To determine the frequency of helicobacter pylori infection in patients of acne vulgaris Study design: Descriptive, cross-sectional study. Settings and duration: Dermatology Department, Liaquat University of medical and health Sciences (LUMHS), Civil Hospital, Hyderabad from 22nd August 2017 to 21st February 2018 Methods: A total of 135 patients, 13 to 30 years of age of both genders with acne vulgaris were included in this study. Patients with H Pylori infection positive without acne vulgaris, family history helicobacter pylori infection, chronic smoker or alcoholics were excluded. Patients were subjected to relevant investigations i.e. HP antibody titer, for that blood sample of each patient was sent to institutional pathology laboratory for measuring of serum levels of anti H. Pylori IgG antibodies where each report was prepared by consultant pathologist. Results: Mean age was 23.33 ± 4.14 years. Out of these 135 patients, 48 (35.56%) were females and 87 (64.44%) were males with female to male ratio of 1:1.8. Frequency of helicobacter pylori infection in patients of acne vulgaris was seen in 107 (79.26%) patients. Conclusion: This study concluded that frequency of helicobacter pylori infection in patients of acne vulgaris is very high and these patients should be screened for helicobacter pylori infection Keywords: Acne, helicobacter pylori, association INTRODUCTION manifested in both inflammatory and non- inflammatory forms.

From season one winner Kelly Clarkson to country queen Carrie Underwood, click through the gallery to look back at all of the singers who have triumphed over their competition to be crowned the ultimate American Idol. 1 / 22 Season 22: Abi Carter Disney/Eric McCandless After winning over the judges in her audition with an amazing rendition of Billie Eilish's \\\"What Was I Made For?,\\\" Abi Carter remained a fan-favorite throughout her run on season 22. Each of her performances in the season finale was met with overwhelming applause from the crowd, and she was brought to tears as she was named the new American Idol. Season 21: Iam Tongi Eric McCandless/ABC via Getty Images After weeks of heated competition, themed musical nights, emotional backstories, and surprising departures, American Idol 's season 21 finale came down to Megan Danielle, Colin Stough and Tongi. However, it was the 18-year-old singer who wound up walking away the season champion. ET's Denny Directo spoke with Tongi on the carpet after his big win and the talented vocalist was still in shock over the outcome, explaining, \\\"I need a while it to set in, man, you know what I mean?\\\" On Sunday's show, he wowed with a stellar performance of his original song, \\\"I’ll Be Seeing You,\\\" and delivered a gorgeous cover of \\\"Monsters\\\" in a special duet with James Blunt. Season 20: Noah Thompson Eric McCandless/ABC via Getty Images Season 20's finale -- which was Bruce Springsteen-themed -- all came down to the season's top three: Leah Marlene, HunterGirl and Thompson. But after all the songs were sung and votes were counted, it was the 19-year-old Thompson who walked away the new champion . ET's Denny Directo spoke with Noah after the show, and the new Idol winner was still in shock, joking, \\\"I don't know what to do right now.\\\" The young winner is, himself, the father of a baby boy, and he told ET, that the best part of all of this was doing something he could show his kid when he got older. \\\"That, for me, that's the biggest thing out of all this. Because, you know, I wanted to do this for him,\\\" Noah shared. \\\"I ended up looking up to my dad that way, so maybe I think that's the best part of all of this whole process. I think that's what's cool about it.\\\" Season 19: Chayce Beckham Eric McCandless/ABC The rocker from Apple Valley, California, stunned time and again throughout the season and brought his raspy vocals and powerhouse presence to win big during the Season 19 finale . Beckham beat out third-place finalist Grace Kinstler and runner-up Willie Spence with three show-stopping performances. First, he sang The Beatles' classic \\\"Blackbird,\\\" followed by \\\"Fire Away\\\" by Chris Stapleton, and finally \\\"Afterglow\\\" by Ed Sheeran. He closed out the finale with a live performance of his original tune \\\"23,\\\" as golden confetti rained down around him on stage. Season 18: Just Sam ABC via Getty Images The first-ever remote finale (due to the coronavirus pandemic ) saw a final five face-off between Dillon James, Francisco Martin, Just Sam, Arthur Gunn and Jonny West, who each performed during two rounds, giving them two chances to win over voters and capture America's heart.

It aired on Fox from June 11, 2002, to April 7, 2016, for 15 seasons. It was on hiatus until March 11, 2018, when a revival of the series began airing on ABC . It started as an addition to the Idol format that was based on Pop Idol from British television, in which the programme's first series , which was won by Will Young , ended over four months before the show began, as it later became one of the most successful shows in the history of American television . The concept of the series involves discovering recording stars from unsigned singing talents, with the winner determined by American viewers using phones, Internet platforms, and SMS text voting. The winners of the first twenty-three seasons, as chosen by viewers, are Kelly Clarkson , Ruben Studdard , Fantasia Barrino , Carrie Underwood , Taylor Hicks , Jordin Sparks , David Cook , Kris Allen , Lee DeWyze , Scotty McCreery , Phillip Phillips , Candice Glover , Caleb Johnson , Nick Fradiani , Trent Harmon , Maddie Poppe , Laine Hardy , Just Sam , Chayce Beckham , Noah Thompson , Iam Tongi , Abi Carter , and Jamal Roberts . American Idol employs a select panel of judges who critique the contestants' performances. The original judges, for seasons one through eight, were record producer and music manager Randy Jackson , singer and choreographer Paula Abdul , and music executive and manager Simon Cowell . The judging panel for the last three seasons on Fox consisted of singers Keith Urban , Jennifer Lopez , and Harry Connick Jr. [ 1 ] Season sixteen brought three new judges: singers Luke Bryan , Katy Perry , and Lionel Richie . Beginning in the twenty-third season, Underwood replaced Perry, alongside returning judges Bryan and Richie. The show has been hosted by television presenter Ryan Seacrest throughout its run, apart from the show's inaugural season when comedian Brian Dunkleman joined Seacrest as co-host. The success of American Idol has been described as \\\"unparalleled in broadcasting history\\\". [ 2 ] A rival TV executive said the series was \\\"the most impactful show in the history of television\\\". [ 3 ] It became a recognized springboard for launching the career of many artists as bona fide stars. According to Billboard magazine , in its first ten years, \\\" Idol has spawned 345 Billboard chart-toppers and a platoon of pop idols, including Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood, Chris Daughtry , Fantasia, Ruben Studdard, Jennifer Hudson , Clay Aiken , Adam Lambert , and Jordin Sparks while remaining a TV ratings juggernaut.\\\" [ 4 ] For an unprecedented eight consecutive years, from the 2003–04 televisio\"\n}\n**Web Page 3:**\n{\n  \"id\": 3,\n  \"title\": \"All 22 'American Idol' winners ranked from least to most successful.\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/americanidol/comments/1j7jegk/all_22_american_idol_winners_ranked_from_least_to/\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"All 22 'American Idol' winners ranked from least to most successful. : r/americanidol.\",\n  \"context\": \"Reddit - The heart of the internet Skip to main content Open menu Open navigation Go to Reddit Home r/americanidol A chip A close button Log In Log in to Reddit Expand user menu Open settings menu Go to americanidol r/americanidol r/americanidol This is your place to discuss all things \\\"American Idol.\\\" The performances, the judges, the past contestants — it's all right here.

Kevin Winter/ImageDirect American Idol just wrapped its 23rd season, after months of looking for the latest aspiring singer to join its long history of superstars who have gained successful careers from the competition since it launched in 2002. Throughout the show’s 23-year history, viewers have seen singers from all genres and of all ages take the crown – and also a mix of celebrity judges helping the contestants through the competition, starting with OGs Simon Cowell, Randy Jackson and Paula Abdul leading all the way up to the current panel of Carrie Underwood, Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan. (The one constant: Ryan Seacrest has been the host of every season, even moving with the show from its original home of Fox to its current home of ABC.) Related 50 Best ‘American Idol’ Alumni of All Time On May 18, Jamal Roberts rose above the competition, beating finalists John Foster and Breanna Nix for the season 23 crown. During the finale, he performed TEEKS’ 2021 song “First Time” as well as The Temptations’ classic “Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)” — a two-week No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1971. When the top 12 was revealed last month, Roberts told Billboard about being a P.E. teacher and a father to Harmoni and Lyrik, as well as newborn baby Gianna. “I had some great role models in my life and they were schoolteachers. They inspired me and I know I was a handful, but they didn’t give up on me. They saw my flaws, but they knew I had a gift for singing. I had some great principals. I was different and they made it easy for me. Being a dad is great. Some people say don’t have kids before you’re married. Growing up in the church, of course we knew to be married before we had kids. I wasn’t, but being a dad is literally the best thing that ever happened to me.” See below for a complete list of American Idol winners. Season 1 The first season of American Idol premiered on June 11, 2002, and a 20-year-old Kelly Clarkson stood in front of judges Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson in Dallas, Texas to audition with Etta James’ “At Last” and Madonna’s “Express Yourself.” Season 1’s hosts were Ryan Seacrest and Brian Dunkleman. Judges: Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson Winner: Kelly Clarkson Season 2 Seacrest became the lone host of the series following Dunkleman’s departure in season 2. The final two contestants were both male this season, with Clay Aiken and Ruben Studdard competing for the win. Studdard took the title after performing his winning song “Flying Without Wings.” Judges: Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson Winner: Ruben Studdard Season 3 The third season was won by Fantasia Barrino, who defeated Diana DeGarmo by a small margin of votes. Season 3 also introduced the world to Jennifer Hudson. Judges: Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson Winner: Fantasia Barrino Season 4 Idol ‘s fourth season crowned Carrie Underwood as the winner, and the then-21-year-old songstress went on to become a Grammy-winning country superstar. Bo Bice was the runner-up. Judges: Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson Winner: Carrie Underwood Season 5 Though Taylor Hicks was named the winner, the fifth season of American Idol gave the music industry a number of other stars, including Chris Daughtry, Kellie Pickler and Katharine McPhee (the runner-up).

Credit : Christopher Willard/Disney via Getty American Idol has crowned yet another winner. On the May 18 finale, Jamal Roberts became the next champion, winning what host Ryan Seacrest called the \\\"biggest finale vote in show history.\\\" \\\"To be a role model for my girls, my city, and anybody out there chasing something bigger,  this means everything,\\\" Roberts wrote in an Instagram post celebrating his win. \\\"Now I get to do what I love, with the best in the game, and share my voice with the world. This is my dream ... and it’s just the beginning.\\\" The series first premiered in 2002, and it has gone through some changes over the years. The panel of famous judges has evolved from Paula Abdul , Simon Cowell and Randy Jackson to Carrie Underwood , Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie . The 23 Idol winners have experienced varying levels of post-finale success. While some have taken home Grammy Awards and become household names — such as Kelly Clarkson and Underwood — others, like Samantha “Just Sam” Diaz, have found themselves almost back at square one. All of the winners have released music since their time on the show, and many have toured, taken their talents to the big screen or Broadway and started families. So, where are each of the American Idol winners today? Here are all the updates on the popular reality show's champions. Kelly Clarkson, Season 1 Left: Kelly Clarkson at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood, California. Right: Kelly Clarkson visits SiriusXM at SiriusXM Studios on June 21, 2023 in New York City. Steve Granitz/WireImage ; Theo Wargo/Getty In 2002, Clarkson became the very first winner of American Idol. Since her victory, she’s released 10 studio albums and won three Grammys from 17 nominations. Clarkson joined The Voice as a judge in 2018 and appeared on nine seasons of the show. Her eponymous talk show, The Kelly Clarkson Show , debuted in September 2019 and has won several Daytime Emmy Awards. As for her personal life, Clarkson married music manager Brandon Blackstock in 2013. They welcomed their daughter, River Rose, in June 2014 and their son, Remington Alexander, in April 2016. However, Clarkson filed for divorce in June 2020 and later moved to New York City with her kids in the fall of 2023. All About Kelly Clarkson and Brandon Blackstock's 2 Kids, River and Remington The singer released her divorce-inspired album, Chemistry , on June 23, 2023. Her Las Vegas residency of the same name included songs from the album and ran from July to August that year. Although she was the first winner, Clarkson hasn't necessarily kept up with American Idol . During a June 2023 appearance on Watch What Happens Live , host Andy Cohen challenged Clarkson to name a winner of the reality show from the last five years, and she was unable to do it . Ruben Studdard, Season 2 Left: Ruben Studdard during the 'American Idol' Season 2 Finale. Right: Ruben Studdard. Ray Mickshaw/WireImage ; Stewart Cook/ABC/Getty Ruben Studdard , originally from Alabama, claimed the American Idol winner title over runner-up Clay Aiken in 2003. Following the competition, he released a platinum-selling album, Soulful , and earned a Grammy nomination for best male R&B vocal performance for his recording of “Superstar.” He’s released eight studio albums in total and competed on The Biggest Loser in 2013. Studdard was married to Surata Zuri McCants from 2008 to 2012. He is now married to Kristin Moore Studdard, with whom he shares a son, Olivier , and a daughter, Henri . In the spring of 2023, he and Aiken toured together to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their time on the show.

To celebrate (or commiserate, because I'm actually very sad that the show is ending), Yahoo Music's Reality Rocks is ranking the 50 coolest Idol finalists ever. Why \\\"coolest\\\"? Because for years, many skeptics and snobs have written off this show as just some corny karaoke competition. This gallery proves otherwise. These very cool contestants were the game-changers, the mavericks, the edgy and indie types, the ones that kept things interesting and changed what people thought Idol could or should be. Other criteria to keep in mind here: To keep this list from getting out of control, I only considered singers who'd made the top 10 (or top 11, since a couple seasons had bonus contestants). But I do give special shoutouts to some of my other favorites: Brandon Rogers, Josiah Leming, Danny Noriega, Todrick Hall, Alex Lambert, Lilly Scott, Rachel Zevita, Kory Wheeler, Jenn Blosil, Charlie Askew, Jackie Tohn, Alexis Grace, Norman Gentle, and many, many other extremely cool contenders who dared to march to the beat of their own Rickey Minor house band drum. Second, this list is subjective. Everyone has their own Idol favorites; that's part of the beauty of the show. I took into consideration the contestants' Idol performances as well as their post-show work, but in the end, I went with the contestants that just stayed in my heart (or my iPod, or Spotify rotation) the longest. And just the ones that, well, I thought were the coolest. (All photos from Getty Images.) 50. Nadia Turner (Season 4, eighth place) It is an absolute travesty that Nadia didn't make it further than eighth place. The funk 'n' roll diva had serious stage presence and star quality. Maybe she was just a little ahead of her time. 49. Jessica Meuse (Season 13, fourth place) Jessica was a badass with a cool look, great hair, and songwriting chops. Her flat affect and woodenness onstage kept her from getting to the finale over the more outgoing Caleb Johnson and Jena Irene, but her original \\\"Blue-Eyed Lie,\\\" which she got to perform on the show, was a barnstormer. 48. Jason Castro (Season 7, fourth place) His \\\"Hallelujah\\\" remains the definitive cover among the many, many singing-show renditions performed over the years. It helped put Jeff Buckley on the iTunes charts years after his death, and that's pretty cool. 47. Malaya Watson (Season 13, eighth place) This quirky jazz/soul/funk girl wonder described her style as \\\"Slyoncé\\\" (Sly Stone + Beyoncé), which is very cool. She showed tons of promise, even holding her own with John Legend in a duet that was a Season 13 finale highlight. 46. Didi Benami (Season 9, 10th place) She developed of rep for being a \\\"crybaby,\\\" but while emotions sometimes got the better of Didi, sometimes they led to fantastic performances, like her legendary cover of Katharine McPhee's \\\"Terrified,\\\" one of the best Hollywood Week moments of all time. 45.

Introduction: Vladimir ivanovich Kuznetzov (1929-2008) (figs 1-5) is one of the most famous modern Russian lepidopterologists. He was born 28.II.1929 in Kingisepp, Leningrad Region. His father was née Egorov and he was born into the family of a smith. Therefore he was known at school as a smith’s son, in Russian transcription as Kuznetzov (=Kuznetz’s son). Thus, the family name Kuznetzov is in some sense a pseudonym. During The Second World War Kuznetzov lost his mother and lived in an orphanage until his father came back from the War. After that, Vladimir Kuznetzov finished secondary school in Leningrad and entered the biological faculty of Leningrad State University in 1946. He finished there in 1951 and completed his PhD in 1954. In 1955 Kuz- netzov became a staff member at the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Leningrad, Russia (ZISP) where he worked for 52 years. He took part in several expeditions and published more than 200 papers devoted to Lepidoptera, especially Tortricidae. Most of his works dealt with the Palaearctic fauna, but some of them were based on material from the Oriental Regi- on. In total, Kuznetzov described 394 taxa, 295 of them Tortricidae. He died 22.VIII 2008 in St. Petersburg and was cremated at Smolenskoe Cemetery. Twice in his lifetime, in 1986 and 1988, Kuznetzov visited Vietnam as a member of Soviet-Vietnamese zoological expeditions. The first field trip was carried out in spring and all material was collected in the Northern provinces: Son La, Vinh Phuc and Thái Nguyên (earlier Bắc Thái). The second trip was in autumn (9.XI.-22.XII.) and during this time Kuznetzov visited the south of the country in the Gia Lai (earlier Gia Lai-Kon Tum) province. A huge amount of lepidopterous material was collected by Kuznetzov in Vietnam and all of it is now deposited in the collection of ZISP. As a result of his expeditionary work, Kuznetzov published 13 papers devoted to Tortricidae of Vietnam but only one of them was in English. In these works he listed 225 species, described 67 of them as new, and established 5 new genera. Investigation of the type material is an important part of all taxonomic studies but detailed descriptions of the species, with figured genitalia of both sexes and coloured images of the moths, make the work much easier. Descriptions of Tortricidae from Vietnam published by Kuznetzov in 1988-2003 are quite full and figures of genitalia structures are very good. Unfortunately, he gave no photos of the type specimens and all his descriptions were published in Rus\"\n}\n**Web Page 2:**\n{\n  \"id\": 2,\n  \"title\": \"A catalogue of type specimens of the Tortricidae described by V.

The cubes are jumbled, and one is removed. There are 6 cubes with one colored face, 12 edge cubes with two colored faces, and 8 corner cubes with three colored faces. All blue cubes have been found. All cubes directly left, right, above, and below the orange center cube have been found, along with the center cube. The green corners have all been found, along with all green that borders yellow. For all orange cubes found, the opposite face’s cubes have been found. The removed cube has two colors on its faces. What are they? Answer using a comma separated list, with the colors ordered alphabetically.\n\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nTo solve this, let's break down the information given:\n\n1. We have a standard Rubik's cube, which is made up of 26 smaller cubes.\n2. The cube is jumbled, and one cube is removed.\n3. We know the configuration of the found cubes:\n   - 6 cubes with one colored face (corner pieces)\n   - 12 edge cubes with two colored faces\n   - 8 corner cubes with three colored faces\n4. All blue cubes have been found.\n5. All cubes directly adjacent to the orange center cube (left, right, above, and below) have been found, along with the center cube itself.\n6. All green corners have been found, along with all green that borders yellow.\n7. For all orange cubes found, the opposite face's cubes have been found.\n\nLet's identify the cubes that have been found:\n\n- The orange center cube and the 4 surrounding cubes (left, right, above, below) have been found.\n- The 4 green corner pieces that are adjacent to the yellow faces have been found.\n- All blue cubes have been found.\n\nNow, let's consider the removed cube. It has two colors on its faces. Since we know the configuration of the found cubes, we can deduce which cubes are missing.\n\nThe removed cube must be one of the edge cubes that is not directly adjacent to the orange center cube, nor a corner piece that is adjacent to the yellow face, nor a blue cube. The only edge cubes that fit this description are those that are not directly adjacent to the orange center cube and do not border the yellow face.\n\nThe only edge cubes that could be removed are those that are adjacent to the blue center cube or the green center cube. Since all blue and green corner pieces have been found, the removed cube must be an edge cube that is adjacent to a blue or green center cube but not directly adjacent to the orange center cube.\n\nGiven the constraints, the removed cube must be an edge cube that borders both blue and green. This is because:\n\n- All blue cubes and their adjacent cubes have been found.\n- All green corner pieces and their adjacent green faces have been found.\n- The removed cube must have two colors, and the only configuration that fits the description is an edge cube that borders both blue and green.\n\nTherefore, the removed cube has two colors: blue and green. Alphabetically, this is:\n\n\\boxed{blue, green}",

This edition of the Games was notable for its inclusivity, featuring an expanded program for women, enabled by participation from 2,883 athletes from 46 countries, with nearly 10 percent being female. Germany made its return to the Olympics after being banned in 1920, reflecting a gradual easing of post-World War I tensions. The competition spanned 109 events across sixteen sports, with the United States dominating the medal tally, securing 56 medals in total. The Games also witnessed remarkable individual performances, such as those by swimmer Johnny Weissmuller and Finnish runner Paavo Nurmi. Furthermore, this event was the first to be officially termed the \\\"Summer Olympics,\\\" setting it apart from that year's Winter Games. The event fostered a sense of international goodwill, evidenced by record attendance and diverse representation among medal-winning countries, which underlined the Olympics' burgeoning global appeal. The legacy of the 1928 Games includes not only its sporting achievements but also its role in establishing a financial model for future Olympic hosts and enhancing the ritualistic elements of the Olympic experience.

Representatives from Greece led the parade of nations, while the host country entered the stadium last. These Games witnessed an expanded program of events for women and were also the only Summer Games held in a country other than the one hosting that year’s Winter Games until 1948, when St. Moritz, Switzerland, hosted the Winter Games and London, England, hosted the Summer Games. The 1928 Summer Games were also noteworthy for their broad range of medal-winning nationalities: Athletes from twenty-eight countries were awarded gold medals, while five other countries captured at least one silver or bronze medal. Amsterdam had sought to host the 1920 and 1924 Games, but the cities of Antwerp and Paris were chosen first. After competing with Los Angeles for the next opportunity to host, Amsterdam’s selection as host city was announced in 1923 by Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), after which the Netherlands Olympic Committee set about the task of preparing for the Games. Of the sixty-two countries invited, forty-six accepted and sent 2,883 athletes, of whom almost 10 percent were female. Germany was invited to return to the Games for the first time since having been banned from Olympic competition in 1920. Concurrent with the Games were art competitions, sports congresses, and reports on physiological research, including the first gathering of a sports medicine group. The Games Dutch nobleman Prince Hendrik, representing Queen Wilhelmina, officially opened the 1928 Summer Olympics. Dutch athlete Henri Denis took the Olympic Oath. The Amsterdam Olympics were the first Summer Games to initiate symbolic practices that became rituals performed at all later Olympic Games. These included the lighting of the Olympic flame at the Olympic stadium, the selection of Greece as the first country in the parade of nations, with the host country as the final entrant into the stadium, and a public releasing of doves. It was in the marketing for the 1928 Summer Olympics that posters first displayed the Olympic design of five interlocking rings. These Games were also the first to be officially designated the “Summer” Olympics, as well as the first to be conducted in a separate country from the same year’s Winter Games. The 1928 Summer Games consisted of 109 competitions in sixteen sports, plus three demonstration sports. Early competition in football and field hockey occurred in May and June, with the majority of the competition taking place over the final two to three weeks of the Games. Women’s events were extended to include track-and-field competitions and gymnastics, despite the various objections of de Coubertin and the Vatican. Notable Performances Official attendance at the Games’ events amounted to 251,747 spectators, over half of whom were believed to have come for the football (soccer) competition alone. Swiss gymnasts Georges Miez and Hermann Hänggi each won four medals, totaling five gold medals between them. Paavo Nurmi of Finland won the last of his nine gold medals in the 10,000-meter race, along with two silver medals. India initiated a streak of six consecutive Olympic gold medal performances in field hockey by winning its initial gold medal at the 1928 Summer Games. American swimmer and future film star Johnny Weissmuller won gold medals in the 100-meter freestyle swim and the 4 × 200-meter relay events. Then a major general, Douglas MacArthur served as president of the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) during these Games and led the American team presence. In all, athletes from five continents won gold medals, and the Games featured eleven multiple gold medal winners, led by Swiss gymnast George Miez, who received three. The 1928 Summer Games also featured the first expanded Olympic program for women, offering competition in gymnastics and five track-and-field events. However, German runner Lina Radke’s visible exhaustion after winning the 800-meter race contributed to the future limiting of women’s Olympic races to distances of 200 meters or less until 1960.

The fire was lit in a cauldron that was placed at the top of a tower in the stadium, which had been designed by Jan Wils, a celebrated Dutch architect. Olympic Firsts At the Opening Ceremony, the team from Greece led the Parade of Nations, with the host Dutch team marching in last. Greece-first, hosts-last has been Olympic protocol ever since. The number of female competitors more than doubled, as women were finally allowed to compete in gymnastics and athletics, and Asian athletes won gold medals for the first time. Winning Streaks Begin The team from India swept to victory in field hockey. Between 1928 and 1956, India’s men would win six straight gold medals in this event. Another winning streak also began in 1928, when Hungary earned the first of seven consecutive gold medals in team sabre fencing. Innocent Times The actions of Australian rower Henry Pearce at Amsterdam have since become legend. He stopped midway through his quarter final to let a family of ducks pass, but still went on to win the race and eventually the gold medal.

The Amsterdam Games were the eighth occurrence of the modern Olympic Games . Track-and-field and gymnastics events were added to the women’s slate at the 1928 Olympics . There was much criticism of the decision, led by Pierre de Coubertin and the Vatican. Women athletes, however, had formed their own track organizations and had held an Olympic-style women’s competition in 1922 and 1926. Their performances at these events convinced the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF; later International Association of Athletics Federations ) that women are capable of a high level of athletic competition and deserve a place at the Olympics. Most medals by country United States: 56 Germany: 39 Finland: 25 France: 25 Sweden: 25 Note: Medal count per the IOC website . Germany returned to Olympic competition at the 1928 Games, which featured the debut of the Olympic flame. Approximately 3,000 athletes (including nearly 300 women), representing 46 countries, participated in the Olympics. The men’s athletics competition was noteworthy for two reasons. It was the last Olympic Games for the great Paavo Nurmi and Ville Ritola of Finland . It was also the poorest performance to date for the U.S. team, which won only three of a possible 12 gold medals in running events. Percy Williams of Canada won both the 100- and 200-meter runs. Controversy arose in the women’s 800-meter run when several women collapsed from exhaustion at the end of the race; Olympic officials concluded that the distance was too long for women, and it was not until the 1960 Games in Rome that women were allowed to compete in a race of more than 200 meters.

Paavo Nurmi was back and he won three more medals, but only one of them was gold. Johnny Weissmuller was back and again won two gold medals. The 1928 Olympic Games began with a minor controversy, when the Netherlands’ Queen Wilhelmina refused to attend the Opening Ceremony, reportedly because she was upset about not having been consulted on the date of the opening. The Games were instead opened by His Royal Highness Prince Hendrik, but the Queen did attend the closing ceremony. During the Games, there was no Olympic Village, and none was necessary, because many of the teams boarded their athletes on ships moored in Amsterdam Harbour. The biggest story of the 1928 Olympics was probably the emergence of women. The ancient Olympic Games did not allow women as competitors, or even as spectators. If they were found to be watching they were supposedly put to death. Baron Pierre de Coubertin originally did not support women competing in the Olympics and thus, in the modern Olympics, women were admitted slowly and only grudgingly. In 1900, women competed in croquet, golf, tennis, sailing, and probably archery. In 1904, women competed only in archery. In both of those years, the events were hard to define and women’s participation was never officially accepted or approved by the IOC. That was to come in 1912 when women’s swimming was admitted to the Olympics. Track & field athletics has always been the showcase sport of the Olympics. Women were not allowed to compete until 1928, not that they didn’t try. Track & field is controlled by the IAAF (then the International Amateur Athletic Federation) and they did not support the admission of women’s track & field to the Olympics. So the women formed a separate organization, the FSFI (Fédération Sportive Féminine Internationale). The FSFI held its own events, the Women’s “Olympics” in 1922 in Paris, and the 1926 “2nd International Ladies’ Games” in Göteborg, Sweden. It was only after these games proved the success of women’s athletics that the IAAF acquiesced and allowed the sport into the Olympics. On 5 April 1926, the IOC capitulated as well and accepted the recommendation of the IAAF to allow women to compete in track & field athletics at the Olympics. However, in 1928, only five events were held for women, which the FSFI felt was far too few (the men had 21), so the FSFI also held Women’s World Games in 1930 and 1934, before the organization was absorbed into the IAAF. The 1928 Olympic track & field events were so few and in such varied disciplines that no single woman could dominate. They were marred when several women finalists were on the verge of collapse after the 800 metres, a not uncommon sight among men either. The IAAF reacted by barring women from running over 200 metres at the Olympics, which was only changed in 1960. The 1928 Olympics had few of the difficulties that would manifest themselves at the next few Games. The depression had not yet occurred, which would mar the 1932 Olympics. Hitler was still in prison and the post-World War II boycotts had not yet occurred.

The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a NOC. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code . [ 6 ] For the 109 sports events a total of 327 medals were awarded: 110 gold medals, 108 silver medals, and 109 bronze medals. These numbers are unequal, because two gold medals and no silver medals were awarded in the lightweight category of weightlifting , after a first-place tie in the event. [ 2 ] The athletes of 33 countries won one or more medals. The most medals (56) and the most gold medals (22) were won by athletes from the United States . [ 1 ] The countries are ranked by the number of gold medals won by the athletes of that country.

However, challenges persist in explaining the observed emission durations and energetic budgets of cosmological FRBs.  2. **Host Galaxy Insights**:     - The paper reviews host galaxy associations of localized FRBs, noting differences in environments (e.g., star-forming regions in spiral galaxies vs. low-metallicity dwarf galaxies).

Though several models have been proposed to explain the observed data, none is able to explain alone the variety of events so far recorded. The leading models consider magnetars as potential FRB sources. The recent detection of FRBs from the galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 seems to support them. Still, emission duration and energetic budget challenge all these models. Like for other classes of objects initially detected in a single band, it appeared clear that any solution to the FRB enigma could only come from a coordinated observational and theoretical effort in an as wide as possible energy band. In particular, the detection and localisation of optical/NIR or/and high-energy counterparts seemed an unavoidable starting point that could shed light on the FRB physics. Multiwavelength (MWL) search campaigns were conducted for several FRBs, in particular for repeaters. Here we summarize the observational and theoretical results and the perspectives in view of the several new sources accurately localised that will likely be identified by various radio facilities worldwide. We conclude that more dedicated MWL campaigns sensitive to the millisecond--minute timescale transients are needed to address the various aspects involved in the identification of FRB counterparts. Dedicated instrumentation could be one of the key points in this respect. In the optical/NIR band, fast photometry looks to be the only viable strategy. Additionally, small/medium size radiotelescopes co-pointing higher energies telescopes look a very interesting and cheap complementary observational strategy.

Multiwavelength observations of nearby FRB sources can provide important insights into the enigmatic FRB phenomenon. Here, we present results from a sensitive, broadband X-ray and radio observational campaign of FRB 20200120E, the closest known extragalactic repeating FRB source (located 3.63 Mpc away in an ∼ similar-to \\\\sim ∼ 10-Gyr-old globular cluster). We place deep limits on the persistent and prompt X-ray emission from FRB 20200120E, which we use to constrain possible origins for the source. We compare our results with various classes of X-ray sources, transients, and FRB models. We find that FRB 20200120E is unlikely to be associated with ultraluminous X-ray bursts, magnetar-like giant flares, or an SGR 1935+2154-like intermediate flare. Although other types of bright magnetar-like intermediate flares and short X-ray bursts would have been detectable from FRB 20200120E during our observations, we cannot entirely rule them out as a class. We show that FRB 20200120E is unlikely to be powered by an ultraluminous X-ray source or a young extragalactic pulsar embedded in a Crab-like nebula. We also provide new constraints on the compatibility of FRB 20200120E with accretion-based FRB models involving X-ray binaries. These results highlight the power of multiwavelength observations of nearby FRBs for discriminating between FRB models. {affiliations} \\\\faEnvelopeO E-mail: aaron.b.pearlman@physics.mcgill.ca Department of Physics, McGill University, Montréal, Québec, Canada.

Monserrato-Sestu km 0,700,  09042   Monserrato (CA),  Italy Received: 29 \\nJuly \\n2021 Accepted: 8 \\nNovember \\n2021 Abstract We present the results of a multiwavelength campaign targeting FRB 20201124A, the third closest repeating fast radio burst (FRB), which was recently localized in a nearby ( z = 0.0978) galaxy. Deep VLA observations led to the detection of quiescent radio emission, which was also marginally visible in X-rays with Chandra . Imaging at 22 GHz allowed us to resolve the source on a scale of ≳1″ and locate it at the position of the FRB, within an error of 0.2″. The EVN and e-MERLIN observations sampled small angular scales, from 2 to 100 mas, providing tight upper limits on the presence of a compact source and evidence for diffuse radio emission. We argue that this emission is associated with enhanced star formation activity in the proximity of the FRB, corresponding to a star formation rate (SFR) of ≈10 M ⊙ yr −1 . The surface SFR at the location of FRB 20201124A is two orders of magnitude larger than what is typically observed in other precisely localized FRBs. Such a high SFR is indicative of this FRB source being a newborn magnetar produced from a supernova explosion of a massive star progenitor. Upper limits to the X-ray counterparts of 49 radio bursts observed in our simultaneous FAST, SRT, and Chandra campaign are consistent with a magnetar scenario. Key words: stars: magnetars / radio continuum: galaxies / galaxies: star formation / X-rays: bursts © ESO 2021 1. Introduction Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright radio flashes of millisecond duration ( Lorimer et al. 2007 ; Petroff et al. 2019 ; Cordes & Chatterjee 2019 ) located at cosmological distances. Hundreds of these events have now been discovered ( CHIME/FRB Collaboration 2021a ), and yet their progenitor systems remain unknown. A leading candidate source is a highly magnetized neutron star (NS), known as a magnetar ( Popov & Postnov 2010 ; Katz 2016 ; Metzger et al. 2017 ; Beloborodov 2017 ; Kumar et al. 2017 ; Wadiasingh & Timokhin 2019 ; Lyubarsky 2021 ; Yang & Zhang 2021 ), as supported by the recent detection of FRB-like radio bursts from a soft gamma-ray repeater in our galaxy ( Scholz & CHIME/FRB Collaboration 2020 ; Bochenek et al. 2020 ; Li et al. 2021 ; Mereghetti et al. 2020 ). However, the heterogeneous environment of FRBs and their empirical distinction that spans two classes (repeaters and non-repeaters) leave the door open to multiple progenitor channels ( Zhang 2020 ). Accurate and rapid localizations of FRBs are key to triggering multiwavelength follow-up observations, which provide vital information on the FRB host galaxy, its distance scale, the broadband spectrum of the burst, and the presence of any quiescent emission associated with the flaring source. However, FRBs span a wide range of distances, and the majority are too far to place any meaningful constraints on persistent emission or associated X-ray bursts. Therefore, we organized a follow-up program to focus on the closest events ( z ≲0.1), localized to an accuracy of at least ≲10″. Starting from March 21, 2021, the repeating source FRB20201124A was reported to be in an active state ( CHIME/FRB Collaboration 2021b ; Kumar et al. 2021 ), with continued activity over the next few months.

Though several models have been proposed to explain the observed data, none is able to explain alone the variety of events so far recorded. The leading models consider magnetars as potential FRB sources. The recent detection of FRBs from the galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 seems to support them. Still, emission duration and energetic budget challenge all these models. Like for other classes of objects initially detected in a single band, it appeared clear that any solution to the FRB enigma could only come from a coordinated observational and theoretical effort in an as wide as possible energy band. In particular, the detection and localisation of optical/NIR or/and high-energy counterparts seemed an unavoidable starting point that could shed light on the FRB physics. Multiwavelength (MWL) search campaigns were conducted for several FRBs, in particular for repeaters. He... ... Read more Figures (8) arrow_back_ios Figure 1.

These high-luminosity flares challenge the traditional FRB engine scenario involving a seconds-period magnetar. Rather, it suggests a powerful, long-lived but newborn energy source at the location of this active repeater, either directly powering the bursts or indirectly triggering bursts in the vicinity of the FRB engine. {affiliations} Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200030, China The Nevada Center for Astrophysics, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, NV 89154, USA Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, NV 89154, USA The repeating\\nFRB 20240114A was discovered by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) on 2024 Jan 14. With only a 4-minute daily exposure window, the detection of multiple bursts by CHIME in late January indicated that the FRB source had a high burst rate ∼ 15 similar-to absent 15 \\\\sim 15 ∼ 15 per hour for bursts brighter than 1 Jy ms in the 400–800 MHz band [ 8 ] . Since then, follow-up observations in the next few months with both large and small single dish radio telescopes and radio arrays have confirmed that FRB 20240114A had been hyper-active, showing both extremely high burst rates up to the order of 500 bursts per hour with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) [ 9 ] and more than 100 bright bursts with a fluence larger than 10 Jy ms with small European dishes [ 10 ] . The hyper-activity accelerated its localization with interferometry arrays – an initial localization at the arcsecond level with MeerKAT [ 11 ] and the subsequent precise localization at the sub-arcsecond level with the European VLBI Network (EVN) were achieved [ 12 ] . Optical spectroscopic observations then determined that FRB 20240114A is associated with a dwarf galaxy at the redshift z = 0.13 𝑧 0.13 z=0.13 italic_z = 0.13 [ 7 ] . CHIME detected bright bursts in 400–800 MHz between 2024 January 21 and 25, implying the low-frequency burst rate reached about 15 per hour for bursts with a fluence larger than 1 Jy ms. FAST detected a high burst rate (500 bursts per hour) in 1000–1500 MHz for bursts with a fluence threshold of 0.015 Jy ms around 2024 March 5 [ 9 ] . Detections of an increased burst rate at higher frequencies, in the S-band and the C-band, respectively, were reported in 2024 Mid–April and early May [ 13 , 14 ] . These reports likely indicate an evolution of the high burst rate episodes, from low frequencies to high frequencies in time sequence, implying that the FRB central engine probably had been evolving rapidly. Observations of these high burst rate episodes stimulated us to search for multi-wavelength counterparts on timescales of 5 days and longer. The search for γ 𝛾 \\\\gamma italic_γ -ray counterparts with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) was the top priority because of its daily regular coverage of the source and our suspect of the role of extreme relativistic boosting [ 15 , 16 ] . With an aperture photometric analysis of the LAT data by extracting photons in the central point-spread-function (PSF) (68% PSF radius, dependent on photon energy) [ 17 , 18 ] , we have identified three 5–15 day episodes, namely Episode 1, 2 and 3, here after named E1, E2, and E3, during which apparent enhancements of the > > > 100 MeV γ 𝛾 \\\\gamma italic_γ -ray emission in the direction of FRB 20240114A were found (Figure 1 and Methods). These episodes appear roughly coincident with the high radio burst rate episodes observed by CHIME , FAST , and the small European dishes within a week or less. The corresponding 5-day average flux level during the three episodes had been reached only once or less in the entire year of 2023 (Methods; Figure 4 ), implying that there was probably a new, variable γ 𝛾 \\\\gamma italic_γ -ray source emerging in the direction of the FRB during these episodes. In the Fermi/LAT field-of-View of FRB 20240114A, based on maximum likelihood analysis which considers all 0.1–500 GeV photons in the 20 ∘ × \\\\times × 20 ∘ square region centered at the position of FRB 20240114A, only one of the Fermi sources, 4FGL J2122.5 + + + 0345, the second nearest known Fermi source, here after named as Source 1 (S1), has been detected during the period in 2024 when FRB 20240114A is active (Figure 2 ). The most nearby 4FGL catalogue source 4FGL J2125.6 + + + 0458, here after Source 2 (S2), was not detected with the Fermi/LAT data accumulated in 2023 and 2024, respectively. Since the LAT photon events collected in the past decades can be used to statistically rule out any of the known sources that has short-term variability, we therefore focused on an unbiased photon selection among S1, S2, and the FRB position (see Method) in order to exclude the two Fermi sources (S1 and S2) as the candidates responsible for the enhanced γ 𝛾 \\\\gamma italic_γ -ray emission. The photon counts extracted in the central PSF surrounding the FRB, on average, has ∼ similar-to \\\\sim ∼ 25 counts per day in 2024. An interval with a duration of 5 to 15 days corresponds to typically 125 to 375 photons in total falling in the central PSF. It is possible that γ 𝛾 \\\\gamma italic_γ -ray photons may arrive in clusters in the form of γ 𝛾 \\\\gamma italic_γ -ray flares. We therefore looked into photon arriving times for photon clusters in E1, E2, and E3 to identify potential short-term γ 𝛾 \\\\gamma italic_γ -ray flares that might produce the γ 𝛾 \\\\gamma italic_γ -ray enhancement. Selection of photon clusters with short arriving time intervals enforces a filtering of photons – the selection of photons from only sources with short-term variability and stable, bright sources. At the average daily photon rate of 25–30 counts per day, it also helps remove p\"\n}\n**Web Page 9:**\n{\n  \"id\": 9,\n  \"title\": \"[PDF] A Decade and a Half of Fast Radio Burst Observations\",\n  \"url\": \"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/371f/3d69295c5412d64fa3719c473f1ad1731139.pdf\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Multiwavelength Observations of Fast Radio Bursts.

Multiwavelength observations of nearby FRB sources can provide important insights into the enigmatic FRB phenomenon. Here we present results from a sensitive, broadband X-ray and radio observational campaign of FRB 20200120E, the closest known extragalactic repeating FRB source (located 3.63 Mpc away in an ~10-Gyr-old globular cluster). We place deep limits on the persistent and prompt X-ray emission from FRB 20200120E, which we use to constrain possible origins for the source. We compare our results with various classes of X-ray sources, transients and FRB models. We find that FRB 20200120E is unlikely to be associated with ultraluminous X-ray bursts, magnetar-like giant flares or an SGR 1935+2154-like intermediate flare. Although other types of bright magnetar-like intermediate flares and short X-ray bursts would have been detectable from FRB 20200120E during our observations, we cannot entirely rule them out as a class. We show that FRB 20200120E is unlikely to be powered by an ultraluminous X-ray source or a young extragalactic pulsar embedded in a Crab-like nebula. We also provide new constraints on the compatibility of FRB 20200120E with accretion-based FRB models involving X-ray binaries. These results highlight the power of multiwavelength observations of nearby FRBs for discriminating between FRB models.

A wide variety of models have been proposed to explain the origins of FRBs 4 . However, models involving magnetars are presently favoured 5 , 6 . FRBs and Galactic radio magnetars have been observed to produce radio emission with strikingly similar characteristics 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 . The strongest link between FRBs and magnetars was established when an FRB-like radio burst was detected from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 on 28 April 2020 8 , 9 , demonstrating that similar events could be detectable from extragalactic distances. A short X-ray burst was also detected near the time of this FRB-like radio burst from SGR 1935+2154 (refs. 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 ). The spectrum of the X-ray burst was harder than other short X-ray bursts detected from SGR 1935+2154 (refs. 11 , 13 ), but it was not unusually energetic relative to other short X-ray bursts from Galactic magnetars. These observations suggest that some fraction of the cosmological FRB population may be powered by extragalactic, X-ray-emitting magnetars. FRB 20200120E was discovered using the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) radio telescope and the CHIME/FRB system 15 , 16 .

        "turn_1_webpage_analyses": "The March 2021 Arxiv paper \"[Multiwavelength observations of Fast Radio Bursts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07786)\" by Nicastro et al. (arXiv:2103.07786) is central to the current search query. Key findings and relevant information include:  1. **Multiwavelength Observational Strategies**:     - The paper emphasizes the necessity of coordinated multiwavelength (MWL) campaigns across optical/NIR, X-ray, and gamma-ray bands to study FRBs. It highlights that detecting counterparts (e.g., optical transients or high-energy emission) is critical for understanding FRB physics.     - The authors stress that magnetar models remain leading candidates for FRB sources, supported by the detection of FRB-like bursts from the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154. However, challenges persist in explaining the observed emission durations and energetic budgets of cosmological FRBs.  2. **Host Galaxy Insights**:     - The paper reviews host galaxy associations of localized FRBs, noting differences in environments (e.g., star-forming regions in spiral galaxies vs. low-metallicity dwarf galaxies). These observations constrain progenitor scenarios, favoring magnetars or young pulsars in some cases.  3. **Instrumentation and Future Directions**:     - The authors advocate for dedicated instrumentation to detect millisecond-minute timescale transients. They recommend:       - **Optical/NIR fast photometry** for transient detection.       - Co-pointing small/medium radio telescopes with high-energy facilities (e.g., X-ray/gamma-ray satellites) to capture simultaneous multiwavelength signals.  4. **Periodic FRBs**:     - The paper discusses periodic active phases of repeaters like FRB 20121102A (161-day period) and FRB 20180916B (16.3-day period). Multiwavelength monitoring during these phases could link FRB activity to magnetar accretion or rotational processes.  5. **Energetic Constraints**:     - The paper compares the energy budgets of Galactic magnetar bursts (e.g., FRB 20200428A from SGR J1935+2154) with extragalactic FRBs, noting that cosmological FRBs are ~10⁶ times more energetic. This discrepancy challenges models and underscores the need for sensitive high-energy observations.  These findings directly address the search query and advance the previous reasoning by clarifying the observational strategies, instrumental needs, and theoretical challenges in studying FRBs as of March 2021."

The Nippon Ham also put a lot of effort into inviting former coaches who led the recent golden age, Trey Hillman , Masataka Nashida, and Hideki Kuriyama, to the pitch-shita-shippo, but contrary to the splendid stadium, the performance was given to Masahiro Tanaka up to the 4th inning. The frustrating performance that was dragged around with perfection continued. Unfortunately, Kotaro Kiyomiya 's big hit didn't turn into a home run and ended up with a double, or a foul home run that slipped off the foul pole . He allowed it and collapsed with 3 hits (1 home run) to Franco. On April 1, in the second game, starter Naoyuki Uwasawa recorded 1 run in 5 innings, and although he got 2 hits, he gave up 7 walks, so he threw 102 pitches and could not fill many innings. In the end, he allowed Hiroaki Shimauchi to take the lead with a timely hit. In the bottom of the 6th inning, Go Matsumoto 's double and Yuki Nomura's timely hit tied the score, and in the top of the 7th, Seigi Tanaka, who had been traded, faced a crisis at 1st and 3rd base due to a walk and an error by Kamikawabata, but struck out 2 and scored 1. He made a successful Nippon Ham debut by blocking the innings with no runs. In the bottom of the 7th inning, Imagawa's timely hit and Kiyomiya Kotaro 's infield hit made it 3:1 with two runs, but in the top of the 8th inning Tatsumi Ryosuke , who was silent with no hits in 4 at-bats, hit a two-run tie and went to overtime.

The franchise has won three Japan Series titles, in 1962, 2006, and, most recently, 2016. Team history [ edit ] Senators and Tokyo eras [ edit ] In 1946, Saburo Yokozawa , manager of the Tokyo Senators in 1936–1937 (and later a prominent umpire), looked to revive the franchise and soon founded the new Senators . He assembled a team of ready and able players like Hiroshi Oshita , Shigeya Iijima and Giichiro Shiraki , but as a newly formed team the Senators faced strict fiscal management and resorted to using hand-me-down uniforms from the Hankyu Railway's pre-war team (who would eventually become the modern-day Orix Buffaloes ). Former Japanese statesman Kinkazu Saionji , grandson of the influential Kinmochi Saionji , became the team's owner, and Noboru Oride , borrowing heavily from a Ginza cabaret proprietor, became the team's sponsor. Eventually, trapped by a lack of funds, Yokozawa was forced to resign as the team's manager. For a time, the team was even mockingly nicknamed \\\"Seito\\\" (Bluestockings) after a Japanese feminist magazine of the same name . As the Yomiuri Giants ' pet name was \\\"Kyojin\\\", baseball personality Soutaro Suzuki thought that other teams should also have pet names like the Giants, and names such as the Osaka Tigers ' alias \\\"Mouko\\\" (fierce tiger), the Senators' \\\"Seito\\\" and the Pacific 's \\\"Taihei\\\" (tranquility) began to be used by the press . However, the other teams rejected the use of these pet names, so they were not fully adopted. On January 7, 1947, the team was sold to the Tokyu Corporation . The Tokyu baseball club was inaugurated into the league, and the team's name became the Tokyu Flyers . At that time Tokyu dominated the Japanese transportation sector, owning several other railway companies, although it was faced with troubles and the possibility of a breakup. Tokyu purchased the team to act as a banner of solidarity for the swelling company, and managing director Hiroshi Okawa assumed ownership of the club. The newly born Flyers, with Hiroshi Oshita becoming one of the most popular players in the league , began to attract many fans, but the team's administration still went into a deficit. With the formation of the National Baseball League drawing nearer, in 1948 the not-yet-affiliated Daiei club , which had played a few exhibition \"\n}\n**Web Page 9:**\n{\n  \"id\": 9,\n  \"title\": \"北海道日本ハムファイターズ公式オンラインストア｜玉井 大翔\",\n  \"url\": \"https://store.fighters.co.jp/en/hokkaido-nippon-ham-fighters/taisho-tamai/t-1277866733+a-7911707512+z-9-1396352751?sortOption=TopSellers%3Futm_source%3Dgoodstop_FV\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Zodiac Mascot Home Uni Brown Rabbit (Daisho Tamai #19).

Who Was Nikolai Malko? Hard work, perfectionism and patience - attributes for any conductor, but ones that personified Nikolai Malko Hard work, perfectionism and patience - attributes for any conductor, but ones that personified Nikolai Malko In 1929, the director of Denmark’s fledgling State Radio, Emil Holm, noticed a young conductor working in Europe who had recently defected to the west from the Soviet Union. His name was Nikolai Malko. Holm set about luring Malko to Copenhagen - and succeeded. Malko first stood in front of the State Radio’s orchestra on 28 January, 1930. ‘Work ethic and sense of discipline – remarkable,’ he wrote in his diary. ‘An excellent young orchestra.’ The rest is history. Malko masterminded the orchestra’s expansion, schooled its players and gave it the firm musical foundations on which it has been building ever since. He would have been particularly delighted, no doubt, to see what is now the Danish National Symphony Orchestra win the Recording of the Year prize at the 2023 Gramophone Awards. So who was this Nikolai Malko, exactly? Nikolai Andrejevitj Malko was born in 1883 in Brailiv, a rural settlement in the Vinnytsia Oblast - a department of central-west Ukraine. Malko’s father was Ukrainian and his mother was Russian. Ukraine under Soviet rule was no picnic. Sadly, though, it was probably easier then than now, as the country continues to endure the invasion from neighbouring Russia. If nothing else, this seems like a good moment to remember that Danish music life has always owed something to Ukraine, via Malko. At least Malko had the advantage of the Soviet Union’s uncompromising music education system. He studied at the St Petersburg Conservatory and in 1909 was engaged as a staff conductor by the city’s Mariinsky Theatre (then the Kirov). He worked extensively in Kharkiv (Ukraine) and headed the conservatory in Vitebst (Belorussia, around 250km from Minsk, birthplace of Dmitry Matvienko, the Malko Competition’s 2021 winner). From 1926, he was Chief Conductor of the Leningrad Philharmonic; one of his pupils, Yevgeny Mravinsky, would succeed him in the post. While there, Malko gave the first performance of Shostakovich’s Symphony No 2, a work the composer dedicated to the conductor. After his first encounter with it in 1930, Malko demonstrated a high level of commitment to his orchestra in Copenhagen. He conducted the first ever Thursday Concert on 28 September 1933 and was still conducting here regularly in 1957, a quarter of a century later. Malko recorded extensively for EMI. In 1948, he took the orchestra under EMI’s microphones to record Dvořák’s Symphony No 9, From The New World (a piece contestants will negotiate in Round 2 of this year’s competition). In 1999, Gramophone magazine’s Rob Cowan wrote retrospectively of the recording as ‘a supremely natural reading, bracing as Spring air…. The Largo’s solemn closing moments - taken at a very broad tempo - are unforgettably poignant.’ Malko’s career took him to all the major London orchestras - he recorded with the BBC Symphony and Philharmonia - to Illinois, Michigan and beyond. At the time of his death in 1961, he was Chief Conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. Four years later, his descendants in the USA set about establishing the competition that would bear his name. But there was never any doubt as to which orchestra would take ownership of it. Malko’s legacy includes a book outlining the fundamentals of his craft: The Conductor and His Baton . But it’s the triennial Malko Competition that embodies the late conductor’s spirit of improvement, opportunity and hard work. Malko didn’t always have had it easy - forced, effectively, to ply his trade in exile. One quality he apparently shared with many fellow Ukrainians, was steadfastness in the face of the task in hand. There is plenty to inspire us there.

It correctly identifies Finn as the mythical hunter-warrior of Irish mythology and mentions the Salmon of Knowledge as the source of his wisdom. However, it does not mention the specific act of Finn inhaling the poison from his spear to keep himself awake and slay Aillen, which is the correct answer according to the reference response. So the overall score is 4. gpt-4-1106-preview 1 Feedback: The response provided is not aligned with the reference answer. The act of consuming the Salmon of Knowledge is indeed a significant event in the mythology surrounding Finn McCool (Fionn mac Cumhaill), but it is not the act that won him the leadership of the Fianna according to the reference answer provided. The reference answer states that the act which won him the leadership was inhaling the poison from his spear to keep himself awake and slaying Aillen. Therefore, the response is mostly incorrect as it refers to a different event in the mythology of the character, not the one that is directly linked to his leadership of the Fianna. 2023-12-18T19:02:15 2023-12-18T19:02:47 HotpotQA-easy 2 zephyr-7b-beta huggingfaceh4/zephyr-7b-beta-style Roxanne Quimby, is an American artist, conservationist and businesswoman notable for founding which North\"\n}\n**Web Page 5:**\n{\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"title\": \"The 24 Candidates - Malko Competition\",\n  \"url\": \"https://malkocompetition.dk/article/2021/24-candidates\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Which country has produced more Malko winners than any other?

Who will your favourite be? Which country has produced more Malko winners than any other? That’s right: the USA. The first, Winston Dan Vogel, was back in 1971. The most recent was just three years ago, Ryan Bancroft. Another, Mei-Ann Chen, is on this year’s jury. Will another American prove victorious in 2021? It could happen – there are two promising candidates from the USA. But with three each from Russia and Korea, those countries would seem statistically in front. Thankfully, Malko isn’t about statistics. It probably isn’t much about nationality either. Conducting styles used to be divided into certain national traits: fiery Russians, meticulous Germans and passionate Italians. If Malko teaches us anything, it’s that the modern conductor can demonstrate all three characteristics irrespective of where they come from – or where they live now. The welcome influx of female conductors has also widened the scope of what conducting can be in matters ranging from technique to interpretation to dress. 6 female conductors are among the contestants from 15 different countries, from Austria to Australia, who will compete in Copenhagen next week. But once again, Malko isn’t about gender. It’s all about finding the conductor who can get the most and the best out of the Danish National Symphony Orchestra. In reality, only when each of our 24 conductors steps onto stage to lead the Danish National Symphony Orchestra for the first time will we have an idea of what they offer. This year, though, we can get a foretaste of their personalities – both musical and more general. Many candidates have already submitted self-made videos, explaining a little bit about themselves, their background and their motivation. It’s a great way of getting to know the candidates, who can pass by in a blur in the opening rounds. But it also gives weight to the idea that conductors are born, not made. Each of them, in their different ways, seems entirely consumed by music.  ‘Conducting opened up a magical door for me,’ says Andrei Feher from Romania (via Canada). ‘Conducting is a never ending journey of learning,’ says Anton Holmer from Sweden. ‘I feel like some kind of energy-controller,’ says Bar Avni-Pallentin from Israel, before showing us her farm full of animals near Bremen. We see all 24 of our conductors at home, through the cameras of their phones and computers. It’s all very 2021. It almost seems like a miracle, that they will soon all be here in Copenhagen – having travelled from their homes in China, Korea, America, Russia and even from close by in Sweden and Norway. The jury will have their favourite – so will the audience, who will decide the winner of the Audience Prize. Take a look, and you might just find your Malko favourite.

With a heavy heart, we say goodbye to twelve of our 24 contestants. There are always surprises when the jury emerges with a verdict. Perhaps most surprising of all, in this first round, is that the Russians have been eliminated entirely. Statistically, that was the strongest country coming into the competition. Both the British conductors remain with us, as do both the Scandinavians and both the Austrians. As for gender, we now have a perfectly gender-balanced competition with six each male and female. That’s enough about nationality and gender – neither of which are criteria for judging conducting talent. We have heard from 24 brilliant conductors over the last two days, and as I write this, I can see Fabio Luisi locked in an intense conversation with one of the conductors who will be heading home – a sure sign of that old cliché that there are no losers here. So what of the conductors who remain – one of whom will be declared winner in four days? There is a huge range of styles, approaches methods of communication and interpretative visions on show. Who could resist the infectious joy of Chloe Rooke from the UK? She transformed the energy of the concert hall completely. We got similar communicative acuity from the other Chloé (Dufresne, from France), who developed a strong rapport with the Danish National Symphony Orchestra and worked so efficiently at articulating her Haydn. Others who survived the wobbly DR Concert Hall podium and will proceed to the next round include Dmitry Matvienko from Belarussia, who perhaps raised the temperature highest of any contestant so far in his performance of Mozart’s overture to Così fan tutte . There will be plenty happy to see the Georgian Mirian Khukhunaishvili still in the competition, an endearing figure whose natural presence drew a huge sound and imposing sense of theatre from the Danish National Symphony Orchestra in Weber’s Der Freischütz overture. Still, keep an eye out for some of our talented runners-up. What a pleasure it was to encounter Bar Avni-Pallentin from Israel, a true force of nature. How fun it was to see Hankyeol Yoon speak Danish to the orchestra (always an ingratiating move). I’ll also miss Norman Huynh’s graceful left hand and his sense of determination. And not every conductor has a technique like Sergey Akimov’s, that seems like a genuine extension of his own physique and personality. They may be out of the competition, but we surely haven’t heard the last from them. As for our twelve survivors, we will hear more from them – and immediately. Tune in tomorrow from 10am, when the stakes are raised with Brahms, Mahler and Carl Nielsen.

The Program Committee has once more done an incredible job, putting together a rich and vibrant program of sessions and posters, covering all the major regions of the Near East and wider Mediterranean from earliest times through the Islamic period. I am especially pleased that some of our newer sessions—for example, on the archaeology of the Kurdistan region of Iraq and on the archaeology of monasticism—continue to thrive, and I am also pleased that our program demonstrates more and more ASOR’s expanded geographical and cultural reach. Geographically, we will look west in the papers featured in the session “Sicily and the Levant”; to the east in the session on “New Research in Pre-Islamic Central Asia”; to the north in the session on “Archaeology of the Black Sea and the Caucasus,” and south in papers on “Archaeology of Arabia.” Chronologically, ASOR continues to expand its offerings in medieval Islamic archaeology, with a session, for example, on the “Archaeology of the Crusaders and their Neighbors.” The program in addition features a wealth of sessions on more thematic topics: for example, “Glass in the Ancient Near East,” “Material Culture and Identities in the Eastern Mediterranean,” “The Archaeology of Feasting and Foodways,” “Senses and Sensibility in the Near East,” “Materiality of Communication,” and “Landscapes of Settlement in the Ancient Near East.” Several sessions also focus on specific sites—both recent discoveries and insights from sites such as Lachish and Sepphoris, and retrospective looks at the many decades of excavations at sites like Tel Halif and Tel Dan. A somewhat similar session will focus on reexamining the materials from the excavations at Antioch eighty years ago. Other sessions, such as the session on “Archaeologists Engaging Global Challenges,” look forward, and, as in previous years, many of these sessions explore the promises of new technologies: GIS and remote sensing, cyber-archaeology, the use of modern photographic and digital technologies to enhance our understanding of ancient inscriptions, and isotopic investigations of ancient diet and mobility. Two sessions on “Career Options for ASOR Members” also address the commitment ASOR made in its recently adopted Strategic Plan for 2016–2020 to help our members—especially our members who are at the beginnings of their careers—negotiate the challenges of the rapidly changing environment of the academy. On Wednesday night, our program will feature, as always, our plenary address, to be delivered this year by Sarah Parcak, Associate Professor of Anthropology and Director of the Laboratory for Global Observation at the University of Alabama, Birmingham.\"\n}\n**Web Page 10:**\n{\n  \"id\": 10,\n  \"title\": \"The Malko Factor\",\n  \"url\": \"https://malkocompetition.dk/article/2021/malko-factor\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"For nearly three decades, Nicolai Malko worked to get the best from his Copenhagen musicians. Our contestants have just a week.\",\n  \"context\": \"ations on which it rests today – foundations that see it recognised as one of the finest broadcasting orchestras not just in Scandinavia, but in the world. Four years after Malko’s death in 1965, the Malko family set about establishing the conducting competition that bears his name. As his son Georg Malko attests in a video greeting to this year’s event, the competition would embody the late maestro’s spirit of improvement, opportunity and hard work. Like him, it would reward and nurture eager talent. Long Term Project Malko was still conducting the Danish National Symphony Orchestra regularly in 1957. He knew his task in Copenhagen was a long-term one. So does the competition. Since re-booting in 2009 with a wider search field and a stronger prize package, the Malko Competition has taken its responsibilities to winners and contestants even more seriously. No other major conducting competition offers Malko’s package of benefits. During their stay in Copenhagen – on the campus atmosphere of the Danish Broadcasting Corporation’s DR City – contestants will make professional contacts that could well remain with them for life. Every one of their performances will be filmed for posterity. They will have the opportunity to meet orchestra CEOs from around the world. They will benefit from the insights and support of Nicolai Malko’s own Danish National Symphony Orchestra, whose members cherish the triennial competition week as an opportunity to pass on their experience and meet new talent. In George Malko’s words, ‘the competition belongs to the orchestra…a living entity made up of individuals who care deeply about the music.’ For the winner, victory at Malko will be the start of a journey, not the end of it. They will be invited to conduct more than twenty orchestras around the world from Sønderborg to Sydney; to be mentored by one of the foremost conductors on the planet in Fabio Luisi; and to benefit from a year’s strategic career advice from industry specialist and former artist manager Jessica Ford. Every Malko contestant will leave Copenhagen a changed musician – which is why so many choose to stay until the end of the competition, no matter how far they proceed. ‘You eat wonderfully in Copenhagen,’ Malko wrote in his diary from January 1930. That’s even truer nine decades later. Likewise, Malko’s desire to get the best from ‘excellent young’ musicians – and to see them thrive – has never been met more fully.

It runs from Boston 's South Station in a southwesterly direction toward Franklin, Massachusetts . Most weekday trains use the Northeast Corridor before splitting off onto the namesake Franklin Branch at Readville , though some weekday trains and all weekend trains use the Dorchester Branch ( Fairmount Line ) between Boston and Readville. Foxboro station is located on the Framingham Secondary branch line, which connects with the Franklin Line at Walpole. Previously, trains only served the station during special events at Gillette Stadium . Pilot weekday service to Foxboro ran from October 2019 to November 2020; it resumed in May 2022 and was made permanent in October 2023. History [ edit ] Union Station in Walpole The line was extended to Forge Park/495 station in 1988 The earliest predecessor to the Franklin Line began in 1835 when the Boston and Providence Railroad built a branch from Dedham to Readville , connecting with the main line from Boston to Providence .  This was followed, in 1848, by the Norfolk County Railroad, which ran from Dedham to Walpole . [ 3 ] After various mergers and acquisitions, the line become part of the New York and New England Railroad until 1898, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad until 1968, and, ultimately, Penn Central until its 1970 bankruptcy. What is today's Franklin Branch was a portion of the Midland Line of the New Haven's Midland Division , the New Haven's secondary route between Boston and New York; the MBTA's Dorchester Branch and the abandoned segments from Franklin to Willimantic, Connecticut via Blackstone were the remaining components of the Midland Line. In 1910, the passenger route on the Midland Line was a regional inter-city train that continued to New York via the Highland Line segment of the Highland Division between Willimantic and Waterbury, Connecticut , then continuing down the Housatonic Railroad to the New Haven Line . [ 4 ] Service was eventually shortened to Waterbury in 1937. [ 5 ] However, in the 1940s and early 1950s service, including the New Haven's Nutmeg and several unnamed trains from Boston to Hartford and Waterbury continued. [ 6 ] It was shortened to Blackstone when the two southern spans of the bridge crossing the Quinebaug River in Putnam, Connecticut washed out during Hurricane Diane in 1955 .  The bridge was never repaired, and the line was abandoned between Willimantic and Putnam in 1959. MBTA era [ edit ] Service to Blackstone was discontinued in April 1966 when the MBTA began subsidizing the line; Franklin and beyond were not in the MBTA district, meaning that the towns themselves had to subsidize service, and only Franklin agreed to do so. [ 7 ] The easternmost bridge over the Blackstone River was washed out in the March 17-19th flooding of the river in 1968; the line beyond Franklin was abandoned 3 years later, [ 8 ] and is now preserved in full as the Southern New England Trunkline Trail .  Between 1973 and 1976, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts bought almost all track assets in Southeastern Massachusetts, including the Franklin Branch, from the Penn\"\n}\n**Web Page 8:**\n{\n  \"id\": 8,\n  \"title\": \"[PDF] FRANKLIN/FOXBORO LINE - Patriot Place\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.patriot-place.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/MBTA-Foxboro-Station-Schedule.pdf\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"VIA FAIRMOUNT LINE: Operates via the Fairmount Line between Readville and.
